abstract = {Background
Clinical decision-making is a core competency in emergency nursing, requiring rapid and accurate assessments. With the growing integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence in healthcare, there is a pressing need to understand its potential as a clinical decision support tool. While Generative Artificial Intelligence models show high accuracy and consistency, their ability to navigate complex, context-sensitive scenarios remains in question.
Objectives
This study aimed to compare the clinical decision-making performance of emergency nurses from Israel and Italy with Generative Artificial Intelligence models (Claude-3.5, ChatGPT-4.0, and Gemini-1.5). It evaluated differences in severity assessment, hospitalization decisions, and test selection, while exploring the influence of demographic and professional characteristics on decision accuracy.
Methods
A prospective observational study was conducted among 82 emergency nurses (49 from Italy, 33 from Israel), each independently evaluating five standardized clinical cases. Their decisions were compared with those generated by Generative Artificial Intelligence models using a structured evaluation rubric. Statistical analyses included ANOVA, chi-square tests, logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to assess predictive accuracy.
Results
Generative Artificial Intelligence models exhibited higher overall decision accuracy and stronger alignment with expert recommendations. However, notable discrepancies emerged in hospitalization decisions and severity assessments. For example, in Case 2, Generative Artificial Intelligence rated severity as level 1, while Italian and Israeli nurses rated it at 1.98 and 2.23, respectively (P < 0.01, F = 199). In Case 1, only 4.1 % of Italian nurses recommended hospitalization compared to 30.3 % of Israeli nurses, whereas all Generative Artificial Intelligence models advised hospitalization. Nurses showed greater variability in test selection and severity judgments, reflecting their use of clinical intuition and contextual reasoning. Demographics such as age, gender, and years of experience did not significantly predict accuracy.
Conclusions
Generative Artificial Intelligence models demonstrated consistency and expert alignment but lacked the contextual sensitivity vital in emergency care. These results highlight the potential of Generative Artificial Intelligence as a clinical decision-support tool while emphasizing the continued importance of human clinical judgment.}

abstract = {Objectives
Artificial intelligence (AI) is widely used in healthcare for various purposes, with generative AI (GAI) increasingly being applied to systematic review (SR) processes. We aimed to summarize the evidence on the performance metrics of GAI in the SR process.
Methods
PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global were searched from their inception up to March 2025. Only experimental studies that compared GAI with other GAIs or human reviewers at any stage of the SR were included. Modified Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies version 2 was used to assess the quality of the studies that used GAI in the study selection process. We summarized the findings of the included studies using a narrative approach.
Results
Out of 7418 records screened, 30 studies were included. These studies used GAI tools such as ChatGPT, Bard, and Microsoft Bing AI. GAI appears to be effective for participant, intervention, comparator, and outcome formulation and data extraction processes, including complex information. However, because of inconsistent reliability, GAI is not recommended for literature search and study selection as it may retrieve nonrelevant articles and yield inconsistent results. There was mixed evidence on whether GAI can be used for risk of bias assessment. Studies using GAI for study selection were generally of high quality based on the modified Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies version 2.
Conclusions
GAI shows promising support in participant, intervention, comparator, and outcome-based question formulation and data extraction. Although it holds potential to enhance the SR process in healthcare, further practical application and validated evidence are needed before it can be fully integrated into standard workflows.}

To overcome the limitations, this research proposes a Generative Artificial Intelligence Sequence to sequence the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from the Transformers model to generate concise summaries. During the generation of the output sequence, the model takes into account data from various segments of the input sequence by utilizing a modified abstractive cross-attention technique. Specifically, the Generative Artificial Intelligence assists in removing grammatical mistakes in summaries via the application of the Global Surrogate method, which ensures the clarity and fluency of the output summary. In addition, the encoder-decoder model enables the accurate summary generation process, vastly improving fluency and accuracy. Furthermore, the experimental outcomes show that the Generative Artificial Intelligence Sequence to sequence the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from the Transformers model surpasses the conventional text summarization techniques concerning Bilingual Evaluation Understudy of 0.71 and Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit Ordering of 0.73, which shows that the proposed model generates a meaningful summary from the given text.}

abstract = {The integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) into human social contexts has raised fundamental questions about machines' capacity to understand and respond to complex emotional and social dynamics. While recent studies have demonstrated GAI's promising capabilities in processing static emotional content, the frontier of dynamic social cognition – where multiple modalities converge to create naturalistic social scenarios – remained largely unexplored. This study advances our understanding by examining the social-cognitive capabilities of Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro model through its performance on the Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition (MASC), a sophisticated instrument designed to evaluate mentalization abilities using dynamic audiovisual stimuli. We compared the model's performance to a human normative sample (N = 1230) across varying temperature settings (a parameter controlling the level of randomness in the AI's output, where lower values lead to more deterministic responses and higher values increase variability; set at 0, 0.5, and 1). Results revealed that Gemini 1.5 Pro consistently performed above chance across all conditions (all corrected ps < 0.001, Cohen's h range = 1.17–1.41) and significantly outperformed the human sample mean (Z = 2.24, p = .025; Glass's Δ = 0.92, 95 % CI [0.11, 1.72]; Hedges' g = 0.92, 95 % CI [0.12, 1.72]). Analysis of error patterns revealed a distribution between hyper-mentalizing (41.0 %; over-attribution of mental states), hypo-mentalizing (46.2 %; under-attribution of mental states), and non-mentalizing (12.8 %; failure to recognize mental states) errors. These findings extend our understanding of artificial social cognition to complex multimodal processing while raising important questions about the nature of machine-based social understanding. The implications span theoretical considerations in artificial Theory of Mind to practical applications in mental health care and social skills training, though careful consideration is warranted regarding the fundamental differences between human and artificial social cognitive processing.}

Nurses’ clinical research activities have contributed to optimizing the care process and improving patient outcomes, and generative artificial intelligence (GAI) may help clinical nurses strengthen their research skills. To support research, this study aimed to explore the Chinese nurses’ perceptions and experiences of GAI training.
Methods
This study used a descriptive qualitative design. The China Nurses Network conducted a three-day training session on “GAI for Nursing Research” theme, we selected 23 nurses by a convenience sampling method among participating in the training. The researchers conducted three focus group interviews at the end of each day. All focus groups were interviewed face-to-face to facilitate interaction, data collection, and observation. The data were analyzed using conventional content analysis and coded manually.
Results
The results showed that nurses’ use of GAI to support scientific research was dynamic and characterized by evolving perceptions and practices. Four themes and 11 sub-themes emerged from the analysis: 1) utilization efficacy: cope with research ability, affected by many factors; 2) booster research: growth and challenges go hand in hand; 3) role reversal: from GAI-dominated to nurse-dominated; 4) beautiful dream: more features on research, more assistants on clinical care.
Conclusions
The effectiveness of GAI in supporting clinical nurses in conducting research is mainly limited by differences in personal research literacy, lack of ethical regulation, and information accuracy. In the future, it is necessary to improve nurses’ relevant skills through specialized training and promote the standardization of technical regulations to ensure the appropriate application of GAI in nursing research.}

abstract = {Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) are revolutionizing computing education, causing paradigm shifts from the traditional teaching and learning technique. Studies are exploring GenAI tools in computing classes from intro to advanced topics with the aim to showcase how to reshape computing education in this new era of GenAI. This study examined the computing education research landscape to unravel how GenAI tools have been used in that domain, what are the characteristics of those studies in terms of computing topics, context, and tools, offering insights into the pros and cons for integrating GenAI in computing education based on the performance indicators reported in the literature. This study employed a systematic literature review approach to identify and analyze 78 relevant articles. The findings of this study show that educators are exploring GenAI tools in computer sciences classes from K-12 through graduate levels. Beyond programming education, GenAI has also been explored in college upper-level computer science courses such as Computer Graphics and Human-Computer Interaction. The performance analysis of these tools are presented in this study, indicating a progressive advancement from when the technology was introduced. This study also discusses learning outcomes, good practices, and potential risks to avoid when exploring GenAI, as reported in the studies, which could guide how computing educators design their instructional strategies using GenAI. This study contributes to broadening the understanding of exploring, adapting, or using GenAI in computer science education and may spark interest among educators who are unwilling to explore GenAI or may not understand how or what strategies to adopt.}

Traditional interior design education often limits students’ theoretical knowledge, aesthetic skills, and technical abilities development. Generative AI tools such as Stable Diffusion and Midjourney, which utilize big data and deep learning, offer innovative design concepts to address these limitations. This study applies established models—UTAUT and AHP—in a novel educational context to evaluate generative AI tools in terms of creativity, aesthetics, practicality, and feasibility, offering empirically grounded insights for interior design pedagogy. Results showed that Stable Diffusion excelled in creativity, while Midjourney outperformed in aesthetics and functionality, with both tools proved more feasible than traditional methods. Despite challenges such as limited technical support and high hardware requirements, generative AI tools can significantly enhance interior design education by fostering innovation and improving design efficiency.}

Interestingly, 43 % of libraries indicated that they did not think there was a need to use GAI tools with the main reasons given including a lack of staff competencies and the appropriate regulations in the area. For those libraries using GAI or AI, 47 % of them had information about this published on their home pages and 39 % on their fan pages. The most common information found was about the promotion of AI tools, the resources available in the library, organized events (49,67 % of all information) and documents on the subject (36,77 % of the published information).}

abstract = {Background
Complex prompting and unreadiness among faculty and students are some of the reported challenges when incorporating generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) into simulation-based education (SBE) in undergraduate healthcare programmes. However, strategies for incorporating GenAI into SBE are unclear. This scoping review identified current evidence on GenAI technology, its role, study outcomes, and strategies to incorporate GenAI into the SBE of undergraduate healthcare programmes.
Methods
The Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews was adopted. Eight electronic databases were searched from inception to January 21, 2025. Two authors independently screened and extracted data. The PAGER framework collated, critiqued, and reported the results.
Results
Eight studies were included. ChatGPT was the most frequently employed GenAI technology in SBE of undergraduate healthcare programmes, to enhance the students’ cognitive and affective learning. Study outcomes focused on usability. Five core strategies were synthesized: (a) establish guidelines on GenAI use; (b) enhance GenAI literacy; (c) enhance competency in GenAI prompting in simulation; (d) ensure pedagogical alignment; and (e) conduct pilot tests.
Conclusions
The findings provide insights into GenAI integration in SBE in undergraduate healthcare programmes. Further studies on the benefits of GenAI when applied to SBE are needed to demonstrate its impact on student learning.}

abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) transforms the entrepreneurial landscape by providing contextual information, identifying viable opportunities, and facilitating entrepreneurial decision-making. Despite the growing acknowledgment of its use in entrepreneurial activities, this field lacks a robust theoretical framework and practical implementation. This study seeks to fill this gap by drawing on information behavior literature to explore the effect of GenAI across the entrepreneurial spectrum. By leveraging large language models and prompt engineering patterns, we examined how GenAI could generate accurate, relevant, and inspiring content through various interaction scenarios. Our findings suggest that GenAI significantly mitigates early-stage entrepreneurial information asymmetry and supports sophisticated problem-solving when coupled with appropriate domain knowledge and prompt engineering techniques. However, GenAI’s task complexity limits its use in late-stage entrepreneurial exploitation activities. Finally, this study provides insight into research avenues and practical applications.}
