Considering the potential transformative impact of GenAI on university students' learning and research practices, this research examines the patterns of use, perceived benefits, and drawbacks of GenAI among undergraduates and postgraduates at universities in Hong Kong. This research employs the 5E instructional model to systematically investigate the effectiveness of GenAI tools in supporting learning and research among local university students. The 170 valid responses revealed generally positive perceptions of the benefits of using GenAI in learning and research-related activities. However, they also acknowledged its potential drawbacks on ethical issues such as plagiarism and academic dishonesty. In addition, respondents agreed that GenAI could effectively support their learning and research activities despite concerns about potential skill deficits, such as diminished critical thinking and analytical abilities caused by the excessive use of GenAI. These findings highlight the increasingly critical role that academic communities like libraries could play in promoting ethical, effective, and literate use of GenAI technologies through targeted training, tool curation, and research support services.}

abstract = {Objectives
Artificial intelligence (AI) is widely used in healthcare for various purposes, with generative AI (GAI) increasingly being applied to systematic review (SR) processes. We aimed to summarize the evidence on the performance metrics of GAI in the SR process.
Methods
PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global were searched from their inception up to March 2025. Only experimental studies that compared GAI with other GAIs or human reviewers at any stage of the SR were included. Modified Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies version 2 was used to assess the quality of the studies that used GAI in the study selection process. We summarized the findings of the included studies using a narrative approach.
Results
Out of 7418 records screened, 30 studies were included. These studies used GAI tools such as ChatGPT, Bard, and Microsoft Bing AI. GAI appears to be effective for participant, intervention, comparator, and outcome formulation and data extraction processes, including complex information. However, because of inconsistent reliability, GAI is not recommended for literature search and study selection as it may retrieve nonrelevant articles and yield inconsistent results. There was mixed evidence on whether GAI can be used for risk of bias assessment. Studies using GAI for study selection were generally of high quality based on the modified Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies version 2.
Conclusions
GAI shows promising support in participant, intervention, comparator, and outcome-based question formulation and data extraction. Although it holds potential to enhance the SR process in healthcare, further practical application and validated evidence are needed before it can be fully integrated into standard workflows.}

Although the supervised models now in use are competent, they frequently rely on annotated datasets and create challenges regarding uninterpretability and limited generalization ability. To overcome the limitations, this research proposes a Generative Artificial Intelligence Sequence to sequence the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from the Transformers model to generate concise summaries. During the generation of the output sequence, the model takes into account data from various segments of the input sequence by utilizing a modified abstractive cross-attention technique. Specifically, the Generative Artificial Intelligence assists in removing grammatical mistakes in summaries via the application of the Global Surrogate method, which ensures the clarity and fluency of the output summary. In addition, the encoder-decoder model enables the accurate summary generation process, vastly improving fluency and accuracy. Furthermore, the experimental outcomes show that the Generative Artificial Intelligence Sequence to sequence the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from the Transformers model surpasses the conventional text summarization techniques concerning Bilingual Evaluation Understudy of 0.71 and Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit Ordering of 0.73, which shows that the proposed model generates a meaningful summary from the given text.}

While recent studies have demonstrated GAI's promising capabilities in processing static emotional content, the frontier of dynamic social cognition – where multiple modalities converge to create naturalistic social scenarios – remained largely unexplored. This study advances our understanding by examining the social-cognitive capabilities of Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro model through its performance on the Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition (MASC), a sophisticated instrument designed to evaluate mentalization abilities using dynamic audiovisual stimuli. We compared the model's performance to a human normative sample (N = 1230) across varying temperature settings (a parameter controlling the level of randomness in the AI's output, where lower values lead to more deterministic responses and higher values increase variability; set at 0, 0.5, and 1). Results revealed that Gemini 1.5 Pro consistently performed above chance across all conditions (all corrected ps < 0.001, Cohen's h range = 1.17–1.41) and significantly outperformed the human sample mean (Z = 2.24, p = .025; Glass's Δ = 0.92, 95 % CI [0.11, 1.72]; Hedges' g = 0.92, 95 % CI [0.12, 1.72]). Analysis of error patterns revealed a distribution between hyper-mentalizing (41.0 %; over-attribution of mental states), hypo-mentalizing (46.2 %; under-attribution of mental states), and non-mentalizing (12.8 %; failure to recognize mental states) errors. These findings extend our understanding of artificial social cognition to complex multimodal processing while raising important questions about the nature of machine-based social understanding. The implications span theoretical considerations in artificial Theory of Mind to practical applications in mental health care and social skills training, though careful consideration is warranted regarding the fundamental differences between human and artificial social cognitive processing.}

This study aimed to examine the usage, awareness, and satisfaction related to generative AI (GenAI) among undergraduate students at a Traditional Korean Medicine (TKM) college in Korea and to identify factors associated with GenAI use and satisfaction.
Methods
A structured questionnaire consisting of 56 items across six domains was administered, covering demographics, general and TKM-specific GenAI use, satisfaction, educational experiences, and future expectations. Descriptive statistics, univariable analysis, multivariable logistic regression, and correlation analysis were performed.
Results
A total of 234 students across six academic years participated in the survey. Most respondents were aware of GenAI (88.5 %) and used it for general purposes (79.9 %). However, only 16.2 % actively used it for TKM learning. While 70.4 % were satisfied with using GenAI in general, only 45.8 % felt satisfied with its use for TKM education. Factors significantly associated with GenAI use or satisfaction included enrollment in the TKM curriculum, older age, prior major, scholarship receipt, and self-directed GenAI learning. Although only 18.8 % had experienced GenAI in formal TKM courses, 96.2 % viewed GenAI as necessary in TKM education.
Conclusion
A notable gap exists between students’ interest and the limited integration of GenAI in TKM curricula. To close this gap, GenAI should be systematically incorporated into educational programs, accompanied by faculty training and institutional support to enhance students’ digital readiness and learning outcomes.}

abstract = {Collaboration between humans and generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) can result in effective problem-solving methods for smart manufacturing. From this point of view, this study presents how to solve computer-aided design (CAD) problems using GenAI-human collaboration, where a GenAI tool generates structured code (syntax) for CAD while a designer articulates the design intent (semantics). The focus is to see how the information type, model complexity, and prompt structure collectively affect the collaboration. A set of case studies demonstrate that a modular modeling approach with low-level information improves prompt efficiency and modeling accuracy, especially in complex scenarios. This strategy also enables novice and expert users to collaborate with GenAI in solving challenging real-world CAD tasks effectively. The findings support the development of advanced human-AI co-creation systems and encourage future research in areas such as reverse engineering, multi-part assemblies, and collaborative CAD workflows coupled with complex design constraints.}

abstract = {Objectives
Nurses’ clinical research activities have contributed to optimizing the care process and improving patient outcomes, and generative artificial intelligence (GAI) may help clinical nurses strengthen their research skills. To support research, this study aimed to explore the Chinese nurses’ perceptions and experiences of GAI training.
Methods
This study used a descriptive qualitative design. The China Nurses Network conducted a three-day training session on “GAI for Nursing Research” theme, we selected 23 nurses by a convenience sampling method among participating in the training. The researchers conducted three focus group interviews at the end of each day. All focus groups were interviewed face-to-face to facilitate interaction, data collection, and observation. The data were analyzed using conventional content analysis and coded manually.
Results
The results showed that nurses’ use of GAI to support scientific research was dynamic and characterized by evolving perceptions and practices. Four themes and 11 sub-themes emerged from the analysis: 1) utilization efficacy: cope with research ability, affected by many factors; 2) booster research: growth and challenges go hand in hand; 3) role reversal: from GAI-dominated to nurse-dominated; 4) beautiful dream: more features on research, more assistants on clinical care.
Conclusions
The effectiveness of GAI in supporting clinical nurses in conducting research is mainly limited by differences in personal research literacy, lack of ethical regulation, and information accuracy. In the future, it is necessary to improve nurses’ relevant skills through specialized training and promote the standardization of technical regulations to ensure the appropriate application of GAI in nursing research.}

This study examined the computing education research landscape to unravel how GenAI tools have been used in that domain, what are the characteristics of those studies in terms of computing topics, context, and tools, offering insights into the pros and cons for integrating GenAI in computing education based on the performance indicators reported in the literature. This study employed a systematic literature review approach to identify and analyze 78 relevant articles. The findings of this study show that educators are exploring GenAI tools in computer sciences classes from K-12 through graduate levels. Beyond programming education, GenAI has also been explored in college upper-level computer science courses such as Computer Graphics and Human-Computer Interaction. The performance analysis of these tools are presented in this study, indicating a progressive advancement from when the technology was introduced. This study also discusses learning outcomes, good practices, and potential risks to avoid when exploring GenAI, as reported in the studies, which could guide how computing educators design their instructional strategies using GenAI. This study contributes to broadening the understanding of exploring, adapting, or using GenAI in computer science education and may spark interest among educators who are unwilling to explore GenAI or may not understand how or what strategies to adopt.}

abstract = {This study introduces a novel 3D preform design method that leverages generative artificial intelligence to optimise complex forging geometries. The 3D preform shape is simplified by expressing it in a two-dimensional manner based on the geometric features of the forged shape. A beta-variational autoencoder (β-VAE) serves as the generative model, paired with a surrogate model using deep neural networks (DNN) to explore and optimise preform geometries efficiently. The initial training dataset for the generative model is created using isosurfaces derived from Laplace’s equation. A multi-objective optimisation framework is developed to minimise forging load and flash volume and mitigate underfill and lap defects. Preforms were designed using this method and validated through forging experiments on two target geometries: a brake calliper and an electric vehicle (EV) manifold. The forging results of the optimised preforms were compared with traditional isosurface methods, demonstrating that the proposed method reduces forging load and flash volume while preventing underfill and lap defects. This integrated approach combines advanced computational techniques with practical validation, offering a systematic and adaptable solution for the challenges associated with 3D preform design in forging processes.}

By leveraging GAI to analyze International Patent Classification (IPC) definitions and benchmark reports, we developed a system that rapidly generates technology-function matrices, significantly reducing the time required for manual analysis. The method was applied to 2,399 quantum technology patents from 2023 to March 2024, covering four key areas: secure communications, computing, quantum simulators, and sensors. This approach not only aids government agencies in identifying new technological opportunities but also facilitates the industrialization of potential technologies.

abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) presents novel approaches to enhance motivation, curriculum structure and development, and learning and retrieval processes for both learners and instructors. Though a focus for this emerging technology is academic misconduct, we sought to leverage GenAI in curriculum structure to facilitate educational outcomes. For instructors, GenAI offers new opportunities in course design and management while reducing time requirements to evaluate outcomes and personalizing learner feedback. These include innovative instructional designs such as flipped classrooms and gamification, enriching teaching methodologies with focused and interactive approaches, and team-based exercise development among others. For learners, GenAI offers unprecedented self-directed learning opportunities, improved cognitive engagement, and effective retrieval practices, leading to enhanced autonomy, motivation, and knowledge retention. Though empowering, this evolving landscape has integration challenges and ethical considerations, including accuracy, technological evolution, loss of learner’s voice, and socioeconomic disparities. Our experience demonstrates that the responsible application of GenAI’s in educational settings will revolutionize learning practices, making education more accessible and tailored, producing positive motivational outcomes for both learners and instructors. Thus, we argue that leveraging GenAI in educational settings will improve outcomes with implications extending from primary through higher and continuing education paradigms.}
