We believe that holding the conference in person offers significant advantages, including richer opportunities for direct engagement and networking, a more dynamic exchange of research ideas, and a more welcoming environment for newcomers. To accommodate those who, in exceptional cases, are unable to attend in person, we have arranged for the option of proxy presenters (i.e. a qualified person presents on their behalf).This year's conference spans six days, beginning with a day dedicated to the Doctoral Consortium and Tutorial presentations. The following three days feature sessions comprising three Keynote Talks, full papers, short papers, resource and reproducibility papers, perspective papers, lowresources environments papers, system demonstrations, and an industry track (SIRIP). The program also features two Women in IR (WIR) activities (a panel and a poster session). Finally, the last day is devoted to Workshops aimed at fostering discussion and encouraging collaboration on emerging research topics in Information Retrieval, as well as to the LiveRag challenge, organized by the Technology Innovation Institute, and focused on Retrieval Augmented Generation. On Friday the 18th the ICTIR 2025 Conference takes place.Social highlights include a welcome reception, a conference dinner, a student luncheon and student party, as well as the WIR reception and the ICTIR Social Dinner.The SIGIR 2025 technical program is highlighted by three keynote presentations delivered by esteemed speakers, to whom we extend our sincere gratitude: Stephen Robertson (Girton College, Cambridge, UK), Iryna Gurevych (Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany), and Ophir Frieder (Georgetown University, Washington DC, USA).},

This conference series has been founded to foster novel and exciting research in the data and application security and privacy arena and to help generate new directions for further research and development. The initial concept was established by the two co-founders, Elisa Bertino and Ravi Sandhu, and sharpened by subsequent discussions with several fellow data security and privacy researchers. Their enthusiastic encouragement persuaded the co-founders to move ahead with the always daunting task of creating a high-quality conference. CODASPY has become a leading forum for presentation of research results and experience reports on hardware and software security. The conference gives researchers and practitioners a unique opportunity to share their perspectives with others interested in the various aspects of data and applications security and privacy.This year, the call for papers attracted 165 submissions from 32 different countries, resulting in accepted papers from Asia, Europe, and North America. The submitted papers were peer reviewed and subsequently discussed based on their novelty, quality, and contribution by the members of the Program Committee. The submissions were double blind, and all the members of the Program Committee had access to all the submissions and their reviews at all times to facilitate discussion among the members. The submission and the review process were done using Easychair, a web-based software system. Based on the reviews and discussion, 31 Full Research Papers and 8 Dataset/Tool papers were accepted of the 165 total submissions for an overall acceptance rate of 23\%.},

abstract = {Welcome to The ACM Web Conference 2025 (WWW'25), held from April 28 to May 2, 2025, at the Sydney Convention \&amp; Exhibition Centre in Australia. Recognizing the breadth of this year's program, we are publishing two sets of proceedings: one dedicated to research track papers, the Web4Good track, and keynotes; and a companion proceedings featuring the Demo Paper Track, Short Paper Track, PhD Symposium, Special Day, Resource Track, and History of Web sessions. Through this rich assortment of activities, we aim to foster a vibrant community where delegates can share ideas, forge collaborations, and cultivate a sustainable, inclusive environment.Marking its 34th edition, WWW'25 welcomes more than 1,000 industry and academic experts eager to shape the future of Web technologies and applications. The conference logo, depicting the Sydney Harbour Bridge, symbolizes the Web's key function of "connecting" people and information. Originally founded at CERN in 1994 as the International World Wide Web Conference (WWW), this event has long been the leading venue for research, development, standards, and applications related to the Web.Over the years, WWW has introduced important breakthroughs, from The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Web Search Engine in 1998-which heralded Google-to the EigenTrust algorithm in 2003 and the YAGO knowledge base in 2007. In the period between 2024 and 2025, large language models (LLMs) have significantly influenced countless industries and everyday life, prompting fundamental shifts in the Web ecosystem. We anticipate that the research and discussions at this year's conference will spark further breakthroughs in this rapidly evolving field.Continuing the tradition of depth and diversity, WWW'25 accepted 26 workshops and 20 tutorials as pre-conference events. In addition, consistent with previous editions, we feature a Demo Paper Track, Short Paper Track, PhD Symposium, Special Day, Resource Track, History of Web sessions, and Artifact Badging. Some of these are incorporated into the main conference schedule to encourage communication and collaboration among attendees.A commitment to diversity is pivotal to fostering robust, sustainable Web technologies. Our Web4Good track highlights how Web-based tools can address societal challenges, while the Industry Track showcases novel and impactful results from the industrial sector. This year, we have also launched an Emerging World Track to broaden participation from developing countries, as well as a competition track to enhance industry engagement..Organizing WWW'25 has been a true team effort. We sincerely thank the authors who contributed their work, and we extend our gratitude to the program and senior program committees for their dedication to reviewing submissions and offering feedback. We also appreciate the many additional chairs whose efforts ensured that each element of the program ran smoothly. Together, they have helped this conference continue to grow into a premier event for the Web research community.Finally, we would like to thank ACM SIGWEB and our industry sponsors-Meta, Huawei, Google, Baidu, Taobao, JD, and Infinigence-for their generous support, as well as our local government sponsors, Business Event Sydney and the NSW Government. We are equally grateful to our academic partner, the University of Technology Sydney, and the PCO company, ICMSA, for their indispensable help with registration, venue logistics, and social events. Their collective contributions have made the 2025 edition of this conference a resounding success.},

UbiComp and ISWC are premier interdisciplinary venues for international researchers, designers, developers, practitioners and educators in the field to present and discuss novel and impactful research in interactive, mobile, wearable and ubiquitous computing. The companion program has traditionally been a very important part of the UbiComp/ISWC conference series.UbiComp/ISWC 2024 is held from October 5 to 9, 2024 in Melbourne, Australia. Originally, UbiComp/ISWC was scheduled to take place in Melbourne in 2021. However, due to the significant impact of COVID-19, our community decided to postpone conferences taking place in their traditional form until last year, when UbiComp took place as an in-person event in Mexico. Now, in 2024 we look to consolidate the strength and ties in our community by having another fully in-person event and hoping to welcome a new generation of researchers to meet and explore the wonderful people that make up our community.},
