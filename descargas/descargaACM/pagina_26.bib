abstract = {Large language models such as GPT-3 and ChatGPT can mimic human-to-human conversation with unprecedented fidelity, which enables many applications such as conversational agents for education and non-player characters in video games. In this work, we investigate the underlying personality structure that a GPT-3-based chatbot expresses during conversations with a human. We conducted a user study to collect 147 chatbot personality descriptors from 86 participants while they interacted with the GPT-3-based chatbot for three weeks. Then, 425 new participants rated the 147 personality descriptors in an online survey. We conducted an exploratory factor analysis on the collected descriptors and show that, though overlapping, human personality models do not fully transfer to the chatbot's personality as perceived by humans. We also show that the perceived personality is significantly different from that of virtual personal assistants, where users focus rather on serviceability and functionality. We discuss the implications of ever-evolving large language models and the change they affect in users' perception of agent personalities.},

abstract = {Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Computer Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW) have a longstanding tradition of interrogating the values that underlie systems in order to create novel and accessible experiences. In this work, we use a neurodiversity framing to examine how people with ways of thinking, speaking, and being that differ from normative assumptions are perceived by researchers seeking to study and design social computing systems for neurodivergent people. From a critical analysis of 84 publications systematically gathered across a decade of social computing research, we determine that research into social computing with neurodiverse participants is largely medicalized, adheres to historical stereotypes of neurodivergent children and their families, and is insensitive to the wide spectrum of neurodivergent people that are potential users of social technologies. When social computing systems designed for neurodivergent people rely upon a conception of disability that restricts expression for the sake of preserving existing norms surrounding social experience, the result is often simplistic and restrictive systems that prevent users from "being social" in a way that feels natural and enjoyable. We argue that a neurodiversity perspective informed by critical disability theory allows us to engage with alternative forms of sociality as meaningful and desirable rather than a deficit to be compensated for. We conclude by identifying opportunities for researchers to collaborate with neurodivergent users and their communities, including the creation of spectrum-conscious social systems and the embedding of double empathy into systems for more equitable design.},

To unpack people’s attitude towards and experience with generative AI-powered writing assistants, in this paper, we conduct an experiment to understand whether and how much value people attach to AI assistance, and how the incorporation of AI assistance in writing workflows changes people’s writing perceptions and performance. Our results suggest that people are willing to forgo financial payments to receive writing assistance from AI, especially if AI can provide direct content generation assistance and the writing task is highly creative. Generative AI-powered assistance is found to offer benefits in increasing people’s productivity and confidence in writing. However, direct content generation assistance offered by AI also comes with risks, including decreasing people’s sense of accountability and diversity in writing. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings.},

abstract = {The threatening environmental problems of our time challenge the notion that humans are separate from and dominant over nature. As a result, many studies in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) address alternatives to human-centered design and explore post-anthropocentric approaches that decenter humans and consider nature in technology design. The question, however, is how to design post-anthropocentric technology that engages humans and nature. Based on the PRISMA-ScR guidelines, we conducted a scoping review and analyzed 53 papers, from which we extracted 114 post-anthropocentric artifacts that enable human-nature engagement. We identified seven design strategies, such as recognizing, exploring, and empowering that can guide the future design of post-anthropocentric artifacts. Most of the artifacts included support human agency, fewer support nature's agency, or advocate for nature to achieve an equitable human-nature relation. We identified opportunities for the field, such as empowering nature and further exploring the implications of post-anthropocentric design for addressing environmental problems.},

abstract = {Affectively driven algorithmic composition (AAC) is a rapidly growing field that exploits computer-aided composition in order to generate new music with particular emotional qualities or affective intentions. An AAC system was devised in order to generate a stimulus set covering nine discrete sectors of a two-dimensional emotion space by means of a 16-channel feed-forward artificial neural network. This system was used to generate a stimulus set of short pieces of music, which were rendered using a sampled piano timbre and evaluated by a group of experienced listeners who ascribed a two-dimensional valence-arousal coordinate to each stimulus. The underlying musical feature set, initially drawn from the literature, was subsequently adjusted by amplifying or attenuating the quantity of each feature in order to maximize the spread of stimuli in the valence-arousal space before a second listener evaluation was conducted. This process was repeated a third time in order to maximize the spread of valence-arousal coordinates ascribed to the generated stimulus set in comparison to a spread taken from an existing prerated database of stimuli, demonstrating that this prototype AAC system is capable of creating short sequences of music with a slight improvement on the range of emotion found in a stimulus set comprised of real-world, traditionally composed musical excerpts.},

abstract = {Following Facebook's introduction of the "Like" in 2009, CaringBridge (a nonprofit health journaling platform) implemented a "Heart" symbol as a single-click reaction affordance in 2012. In 2016, Facebook expanded its Like into a set of emotion-based reactions. In 2021, CaringBridge likewise added three new reactions: "Prayer", "Happy", and "Sad." Through user surveys (N=808) and interviews (N=13), we evaluated this product launch. Unlike Likes on mainstream social media, CaringBridge's single-click Heart was consistently interpreted as a simple, meaningful expression of acknowledgement and support. Although most users accepted the new reactions, the product launch transformed user perceptions of the feature and ignited major disagreement regarding the meanings and functions of reactions in the high stakes context of health crises. Some users found the new reactions to be useful, convenient, and reducing of caregiver burden; others felt they cause emotional harms by stripping communication of meaningful expression and authentic care. Overall, these results surface tensions for small social media platforms that need to survive amidst giants, as well as highlighting crucial trade-offs between the cognitive effort, meaningfulness, and efficiency of different forms of Computer-Mediated Communication (CMC). Our work provides three contributions to support researchers and designers in navigating these tensions: (1) empirical knowledge of how users perceived the reactions launch on CaringBridge; (2) design implications for improving health-focused CMC; and (3) concrete questions to guide future research into reactions and health-focused CMC.},

In this survey article, we provide a structured review of deep learning methods in image captioning by presenting a comprehensive taxonomy and discussing each method category in detail. Additionally, we examine the datasets commonly employed in image captioning research, as well as the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of different captioning models. We address the challenges faced in this field by emphasizing issues such as object hallucination, missing context, illumination conditions, contextual understanding, and referring expressions. We rank different deep learning methods’ performance according to widely used evaluation metrics, giving insight into the current state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we identify several potential future directions for research in this area, which include tackling the information misalignment problem between image and text modalities, mitigating dataset bias, incorporating vision-language pre-training methods to enhance caption generation, and developing improved evaluation tools to accurately measure the quality of image captions.},

abstract = {As Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues transforming workplaces globally, particularly within the Information Technology (IT) industry, understanding its impact on IT professionals and computing curricula is crucial. This research builds on joint work from two countries, addressing concerns about AI's increasing influence in IT sector workplaces and its implications for tertiary education. The study focuses on AI technologies such as generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs). It examines how they are perceived and adopted and their effects on workplace dynamics, task allocation, and human-system interaction.IT professionals, noted as early adopters of AI, offer valuable insights into the interplay between AI and work engagement, highlighting the significant competencies required for digital workplaces. This study employs a dual-method approach, combining a systematic and multi-vocal literature review and qualitative research methods. These included a thematic analysis of a set of 47 interviews conducted between March and May of 2024 with IT professionals in two countries (New Zealand and Sweden). The research aimed to understand the implications for computing students, education curricula, and the assessment of emerging professional competencies.The literature review found insufficient evidence addressing comprehensive AI practice methodologies, highlighting the need to both develop and regulate professional competencies for effective AI integration. Key interview findings revealed diverse levels of GenAI adoption, ranging from individual experimentation to institutional integration. Participants generally expressed positive attitudes toward the technology and were actively pursuing self-learning despite some concerns. The themes emerging from the interviews included AI's role in augmenting human tasks, privacy and security concerns, productivity enhancements, legal and ethical challenges, and the evolving need for new competencies in the workplace.The study underscores the critical role of competency frameworks in guiding professional development and ensuring preparedness for an AI-driven environment. Additionally, it highlights the need for educational institutions to adapt curricula to address these emerging demands effectively},

abstract = {This paper presents Generative Visual Renku (GVR), a new genre of visual interactive/generative art form inspired by Japanese renku poetry and generative contemporary art. GRIOT, a system for composing generative and interactive multimedia discourse, is used to semantically constrain generated output both visually and conceptually. GVR utilizes GRIOT to implement constraints for visual composition, revealing new technical and aesthetic challenges. Since modular animated graphical systems are ubiquitous in computing culture, ranging from avatars to GUIs, GVR works pose a contribution to a breadth of HCI research and to the development of new theory and technology for integrating AI and the arts.},

abstract = {Abstraction is a fundamental yet challenging skill to teach and learn in Computer Science education. Traditional frameworks of abstraction and concept formation often emphasize understanding an abstraction over its application, the latter being critical for practical Computer Science. Additionally, a common issue in education is when students may understand a concept in a classroom or a very specific setting but struggle to apply it outside of that context. In response, we present here a novel pedagogical framework designed to enhance both the development and application of abstraction skills in diverse educational contexts within the field of Computer Science. Our framework synthesizes common themes from existing models while introducing a new dimension focused explicitly on the actionable development of abstraction skills. Educators can adapt the framework to various educational contexts to support development of students' abstraction skills. Our framework was iteratively developed through a combination of theoretical analysis and reflective practice across multiple teaching contexts. We demonstrate the suitability of the framework by applying it to various case studies, demonstrating its broad applicability and practical utility. By offering a flexible yet comprehensive structure, our framework enables educators to effectively organize and deliver educational content, guiding students from abstract theoretical concepts to their practical application in Computer Science.},

abstract = {In these proceedings, we present papers from the Working Groups that worked in the context of the 29th Annual Conference on Innovation \&amp; Technology in Computer Science Education (ITiCSE), held in Milan Italy, and hosted by Universit\`{a} degli Studi di Milano from the 8th to the 10th of July 2024.The concept of Working Groups has been a unique feature of the ITiCSE conference series since its inception. Working Groups are now part of CompEd and SIGCSE Virtual. An ITiCSE Working Group is typically composed of 8-12 researchers who work together for about nine months on a research project related to computing education. Working Groups provide a wonderful opportunity to work intensively on a topic of interest with an international group of computing education researchers. This unique experience is one that, in our opinion, each Computer Science Educator should strive to participate in at least once.In 2024, 13 proposals for Working Groups were received and ten Working Groups were selected by the Working Group chairs to recruit members and proceed for ITiCSE 2024. There were 166 member applications to Working Groups, with 134 being accepted including 33 Working Group leaders across the ten Working Groups. This is a record number of both Working Groups and Working Group members at a single conference.Working Groups began their work virtually from March up until the beginning of the ITiCSE conference. Their work included intensive collaboration on-site for the three days prior to the conference. A draft report was then submitted on the Sunday prior to the conference; a few weeks after the conference, the Working Groups submitted their final report for peer review.If the report was accepted for publication, the groups revised it based on the reviewers' comments and suggestions. This dedicated ITiCSE Working Group proceedings volume presents the final camera-ready version of the reports. We are glad that all ten papers were selected for publication in these proceedings for the ACM Digital Library.},
