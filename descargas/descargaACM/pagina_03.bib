abstract = {With the rapid expansion of the mobile commerce industry, the demand for visual design has increased sharply, and the shortage of professional designer has become a bottleneck restricting the development of the industry. In order to solve this contradiction, this paper focuses on the application research of AI painting technology, especially through a series of computer optimization techniques to improve key links such as image preprocessing, model selection and output optimization, so as to better meet the unique needs of visual communication in mobile commerce. In this paper, the image preprocessing is divided into portrait, product and scene, which are classified according to the characteristics of the collected images, and then different LoRA models are trained to match the Checkpoint model to generate images that meet the characteristics of mobile commerce, thus improving the application efficiency and flexibility of AI painting. Through the selection and optimization of these technologies, AI painting technology can more effectively adapted to the production mode of mobile business design, thus improving the work efficiency of the industry, reducing the dependence on human resources, and providing new solutions for the development of the industry..},

abstract = {An improved adaptive 3D ResNet-18 residual network gait recognition method is proposed for the problem of recognizing people's identity in videos captured by UAVs. Using a combination of gait feature extraction and deep learning models, human silhouettes are separated from complex backgrounds for modeling, and their gait features are extracted for identification.3D ResNet-18 residual network learns spatio-temporal features to extract temporal and spatial features in the sequence of video frames and introduces a cross-entropy loss function to optimize the model and improve the prediction accuracy. When dealing with the challenges of motion blurring in the video captured by drones and shadows and noise interference in background modeling, the improved MOG2 background separation algorithm detects pedestrian gait and models it, and adaptive variance thresholding improves the background detection capability and improves the spatio-temporal feature extraction and optimization, which significantly improves the robustness of the model. The experiments use the Walking category in the KTH public dataset, and the results show that the model exhibits good recognition results in different backgrounds. This approach effectively improves the performance of UAVs in applications such as security surveillance.},

abstract = {With the wide application of deep learning in computer vision, Transformer-based target detection methods, especially DETR, have become a research hotspot. However, DETR still faces low detection accuracy and efficiency problems when dealing with small objects and complex backgrounds. In order to enhance the performance of DETR in aircraft detection, this paper proposes an aircraft detection method based on an improved DETR architecture, which mainly consists of two innovative improvements: first, an ECA attention mechanism is introduced after CNN feature extraction to enhance the model's adaptive learning ability for important features; second, Swin Transformer is used to replace the encoder in the original DETR -decoder structure in the original DETR, using its local windowing self-attention mechanism to improve the computational efficiency and accuracy of the model. The experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper improves the detection accuracy and speed compared with the traditional DETR in the aircraft detection task, especially in the complex background with better robustness and generalization ability. The research in this paper provides an effective improvement idea for the Transformer-based target detection method and provides new technical support for high-precision target detection tasks in practical applications.},

abstract = {One common data augmentation method used in text image recognition is color shift transformations. A widely used method is the Variational Color Shift (VCS), which can automatically predict a range of color shifts for each image. The algorithm has significant overfitting when applied to text images that are highly interfered with and contain noise, which hinders further improvements in text recognition accuracy. In this study, we submit a new transformed layer inside the VCS framework using cyclic boundary shifts over the text images. A new module, Transformed Variational Color Shift (TVCS) is proposed. This method integrates a generalized set of colors (the original dataset) in a manner that can transform the input dataset. The experimental results show that TVCS has superior recognition accuracy than VCS and has better robustness against interference. The algorithm proposed is innovative as the data augmentation of text images, especially in a noisy environment.},

abstract = {In recent years, the increasing number of vehicles has led to heightened traffic congestion. Traditional surveillance is limited to monitoring fixed locations. However, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photography provides advantages such as convenience and a wide perspective, gradually replacing these conventional techniques for traffic video collection. Nonetheless, challenges including complex scenes, varying scales and frequent occlusions result in issues such as false positives, missed targets, and identity switches (IDSW). To tackle these, we developed the UVD detection algorithm based on YOLOv8-n and the AByteTrack tracking algorithm derived from ByteTrack. The integration of these two components forms the UVD-ATrack algorithm. In the backbone of the detection section, we introduced the RFAConv and designed RF_C2f to enhance feature extraction capabilities. For the neck component, the adaptive weight fusion module (AWFM) was developed to effectively combine multi-scale local information. During the tracking phase, we optimized the motion model. Additionally, camera motion compensation (CMC) was implemented to adaptively mitigate the effects of sharp perspective changes. Test results utilizing the Visdrone dataset indicate that mAP@0.5 and mAP@0.5:0.95 improved by 4.4\% and 3.6\% respectively in the detection section. In the tracking test, IDF1, HOTA, MOTA and MOTP also exhibited significant enhancement while IDSW decreased by 77\%. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our proposed algorithm demonstrates exceptional performance.},

abstract = {The automatic spindle detection algorithm based on deep learning technology requires high consistency of sleep spindle annotation, which crowdsourcing can significantly enhance through collective intelligence. To best of our knowledge, few studies have explored auto detection of sleep spindles based on crowdsourced datasets. MODA is the only crowdsourcing spindle annotation open access dataset until now, and this study utilized the MODA dataset to further enhance the automatic detection of sleep spindles using conventional neural network (CNN) and innovative label optimization module. To evaluate our model, we proposed and conducted two analysis methods including analysis by sample-event and by subject. Meanwhile, to validate our performance of our model, SUMO and EXP were considered as control and gold standard methods respectively; and various metrics related to by sample-event and by subject were compared among our model, SUMO and EXP. The results from analysis by sample-event showed that F1 score, Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC), and Cohen's Kappa coefficient in our model were significantly higher than in SUMO under all overlap thresholds. Specifically, under a higher threshold of 0.6, F1, MCC and Kappa reached 0.82, 0.81, 0.81 in our model, 0.75, 0.74, 0.74 in SUMO, respectively. For analysis by subject, all spindle features extraction of our model were comparable to the EXP, including density (4.48 in our model vs 3.80 in EXP), duration (0.79 vs 0.84), amplitude (29.91 vs 30.09) and frequency (13.04 vs 12.92). However, the spindle density extracted by SUMO was significantly different from EXP (9.04 in SUMO vs 3.80 in EXP). In conclusion, our results suggested that the crowdsourced public dataset and label optimization module can further enhance the spindle detection capability of the convolutional neural network.},

abstract = {The Apriori algorithm is among the traditional algorithms that are mainly employed to mine the educational data. Regrettably, the Apriori algorithm is not only the most classical algorithm, but also has some weaknesses, for instance, it has high computational complexity, generates too many candidate itemsets, which in turn leads it to be mainly used in small-scale educational data scenarios only. In this paper, the authors propose a modified version of the Apriori algorithm which aims to the rule generation process and the computational operation more efficient through data preprocessing phase information improvement and using the dynamic thresholding adjusting component as well as a not-so-well-known intelligent technique. The usefulness of the improved algorithm is tested by an experiment with actual course performance assessments, and the algorithm is also applied in the educational decision support system which comprises the course recommendation, teaching strategy optimization, and academic risk prediction the students. The results of the study suggest that there are no gains in script execution speed, generalization rate, or memory usage while there are with great advantage in the run time of the proposed algorithm. Consequently, the proposed algorithm is superior to the traditional one as it provides higher efficiency and thus, could be the best choice for educational data mining.},

For lightweight SISR, we propose a multi-level feature mixing network (MFMN), which achieves high-quality super-resolution image reconstruction at low computational cost. Based on re-parameterization, a multi-level feature generation module (MFGM) is designed to extract feature mappings from different perspectives. Then, to enhance feature details, a feature refinement module (FRM) is constructed to aggregate high-frequency information, which can assign weight values to pixels in feature maps according to the importance of different hierarchical features. Through many experiments, our proposed method shows excellent image reconstruction results in a lightweight way on multiple benchmark datasets and exceeds the current advanced methods.},

However, research on time-series data in the transportation field, particularly on sequence prediction across multiple time scales, remains underexplored. To leverage the multi-scale characteristics of time-series data, as well as its seasonal and periodic features, we introduce two solutions based on DLinear model: multi-scale decomposition and cross-scale information fusion, and propose a traffic prediction model named MIFNetwork. We conduct comparative experiments on several traffic datasets, selecting transformer-based models with strong time-series modeling capabilities for comparison. The results demonstrate that our model outperforms other approaches, especially in handling long time spans and complex trend changes.},

In order to mitigate this constraint, this paper introduces the Prediction of Action Start (PAS) task based on ODAS. The PAS task aims to predict the start times and categories of future actions (if any) in untrimmed streaming videos containing substantial background footage, based on recently observed video information.

In order to solve this problem, this study presents a fan anomaly detection method based on an improved CBAM attention mechanism using the MobileNetV3-Small model. In this model, the conventional SE module is replaced with an optimized CBAM, which uses dilated convolutions to enhance the model's sensitivity to anomalous sounds. At the same time, the model incorporates CutMix and Focal Loss as the loss function, further improving the model's robustness to imbalanced data. Additionally, to strengthen the nonlinear representation capacity of the architecture, we implement CELU activation functions as substitutes for conventional ReLU units within residual modules. According to experimental results, we can find that the proposed model achieves a classification accuracy of 97\% in a -6dB noise environment, which is an improvement of 1.07 percentage points over the original MobileNetV3 model, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach in fan anomaly detection.},

However, cross-subject synthesis faces significant challenges due to the variability in brain structures and tumor morphology across individuals. Existing methods often fail to preserve tumor region fidelity, limiting their practical utility. To address these limitations, we propose the Tumor Representation Consistency Alignment Generative Adversarial Network (TRCA-GAN), a novel framework designed to enhance tumor region fidelity in cross-subject multimodal MRI synthesis. TRCA-GAN introduces two key innovations: the Region-Aware Perturbation Module (RAPM), which enhances tumor structure preservation through adaptive perturbation and joint attention mechanisms, and the Local Contrast Discriminator Module (LCDM), which improves tumor contrast fidelity via a dual physical-feature constraint mechanism. Extensive experiments on the BraTS2021 dataset demonstrate that TRCA-GAN significantly outperforms comparison methods in terms of image generation quality and tumor segmentation accuracy. The results highlight the effectiveness of TRCA-GAN in addressing the challenges of cross-subject MRI synthesis, making it a powerful tool for clinical applications.},

The study reports the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Variational Autocoders (VAE) in artistic style extraction from a large number of datasets and generating innovative images with regional cultural features. The study draws from cultural anthropology's "Three Elements of Culture Theory" in examining the material, organizational and spiritual dimensions. The study identifies three methods of cultural translation: direct translation, consecutive translation, and indirect translation. The study utilizes these frameworks in examining innovative solutions to expressing Henan's regional culture in modern cultural products. It demonstrates how to achieve cultural dissemination and inheritance and enhance cultural identity and global influence in the context of globalization. The study also examines the potential of AI-based image generation in cultural creative design, thus offering a new framework for perceiving and examining the role of computer technology in cultural translation and innovation.},

abstract = {In recent years, as AI has grown fast, generative AI has been used a lot in building design.But when generative AI tries to create Wind-Responsive Passive Building Facades, it doesn't understand the moving look of the facade very well. This makes it bad at telling the important features and not good at working with different design cases.This study tries to make generative AI better at designing Wind-Responsive Passive Building Facades by using the K-means clustering algorithm.First, this study built a dataset with facade images, weather conditions, material types, and size info. Then, using the K-means clustering algorithm, we picked out key features and grouped the buildings by type. The goal is to give generative AI a better kind of visual data to learn from.Based on that, we made a three-level prompt structure to help generative AI work better with different design tasks.This study not only builds a clear method between finding building features and making prompts, but also gives ideas and steps for using generative AI more in sustainable building design.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel UAV three-dimensional path planning method by integrating the Dung Beetle Optimization (DBO) algorithm and the Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm. Aiming at the problems of traditional algorithms in UAV path planning, such as local optima trapping and low convergence accuracy, this hybrid algorithm combines the advantages of both algorithms. The Fuch and Logistic chaotic maps are used for population initialization to enhance the global search ability. During the optimization process, the DBO algorithm's strong local exploitation ability and the GWO algorithm's global search characteristics are coordinated. A B\'{e}zier curve is employed to smooth the planned path. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid algorithm outperforms traditional algorithms in terms of path length, convergence speed, and path smoothness, validating its effectiveness in UAV three-dimensional path planning.},

Given the characteristics of class imbalance and high dimensionality of loan data, data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis are conducted. Based on a comparative analysis of various models, seven machine learning algorithms that demonstrate superior performance are selected for experimental comparison, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Bagging, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. The results indicate that ensemble learning algorithms exhibit higher accuracy and predictive performance compared to single algorithms, with the CatBoost model performing best across various indicators, including AUC.

By integrating quantization into the MPC protocols, PPQformer significantly reduces memory footprint and enhances computational performance while preserving data and model privacy.

The model consists of data augmentation, consistency prototype learning, and dual-layer knowledge distillation. First, data augmentation is applied to the training data to alleviate common overfitting problems in few-shot scenarios. Second, consistency prototype learning is utilized to regularize the embedding space and address feature distortion. Additionally, a dual-teacher model for knowledge distillation is designed to prevent catastrophic forgetting of previously acquired knowledge. Experiments conducted on the TACRED dataset show that after completing all tasks under the 5-way-5-shot setting, accuracy improved by 2.22\%. Our model significantly outperforms other baseline methods, validating the effectiveness of our proposed approach.},

We have enhanced the effectiveness of the method for extracting structural lines using the Manhattan World Assumption (MWA) and have suggested utilizing these lines to construct structural planes, which is different from the existing plane extraction methods. Furthermore, we develop the state estimator by minimizing the visual residuals of points, structural lines, and structural planes. As far as we know, this represents the inaugural stereo SLAM that concurrently employs points, structural lines, and structural planes for integrated optimization. An appraisal of our system on difficult public datasets has been conducted. The trajectory error associated with SLP-SLAM has been diminished by 15\% in comparison to contemporary state-of-the-art (SOTA) SLAM.},

abstract = {In response to the requirements for efficiency and accuracy in segmentation models in autonomous driving scenarios, an improved urban road semantic segmentation algorithm based on the Deep Dual-Resolution Network (DDRNet) has been proposed. Firstly, a Channel Residual Attention Module (CRAM) based on standard attention mechanisms is introduced at the end of two parallel branches of the DDRNet to focus on important channel features. Secondly, the backbone network incorporates Depthwise Over-parameterized Convolution (DO-Conv) to boost feature extraction performance. Finally, a Deep Aggregation Pyramid Pooling Module (DAPPM) with Hybrid Dilated Convolution (HDC) is designed to capture multi-scale feature information, and Group Normalization (GN) is utilized to mitigate the impact of reduced batch size. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a Mean Intersection over Union (MIoU) of 77.0\% on the Cityscapes dataset, representing an improvement of 1.1\% over the baseline model. Additionally, the segmentation speed reaches 106 Frames Per Second (FPS), achieving an optimal balance between segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency.},

abstract = {The Internet has enabled online learning to become an important means for students to acquire knowledge, and student cognitive diagnosis models have played a key role in this process. These models can evaluate students' learning behaviors and knowledge mastery, providing support for personalized learning. Unfortunately, traditional models have their limitations when dealing with complex relational data related mainly to the relationship between students and problems, while the characteristics as well as potential relationships among students are almost left neglected. In response, this paper proposes a Neural Network Student Cognitive Diagnosis Model Based on Multi-Relational Graph (MGNCD) that brings together the powers of Graph Attention Network (GAT) and Relational Graph Convolutional Network (RGCN) to model multi-dimensional heterogeneous nodes such as students, classes, problems, and skills. The introduction of various edge types and random edge connection strategies allowed the model to tackle data sparsity and heterogeneity. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model outperforms traditional methods in accuracy (ACC) and area under the curve (AUC), which provides an encouraging novel insight into cognitive diagnosis.},

In this paper, we propose a semantic segmentation method based on a dynamic multimodal noise addition technique combined with the SegFormer model to improve the robustness of street view image segmentation in complex environments. The study takes five major roads (West Beijing Road, North Taiping Road, Changjiang Road, Yihe Road, and Central Road) in Nanjing as objects, and based on the streetscape and remote sensing data of the vegetation growth season from 2017 to 2022, the Gaussian noise, motion blur, and weather effects are simulated by the multimodal noise addition technique, which effectively improves the adaptability of the model to the dynamic interference. The experiments showed that the Green View Index analysis revealed a general upward trend of street greening (average increase of 0.94\%). Furthermore, the Kendall rank correlation analysis reveals the positive correlation between environmental factors and green visualization rate, and the influence law of environmental factors on green perception is verified. This study provides a high-precision computer vision analysis framework for urban greening planning and promotes the application of semantic segmentation models in complex urban scenes.},

abstract = {Depression is a big public health problem around the world. Like the traditional methods of screening, clinical assessments, and self-rating scales are among the limits. These methods are based on the subjectivity of patient reports and the experience of doctors and clearly can have bias. In addition, they do not permit real-time monitoring of changes in mood. For this reason, this field of mental health is challenged with accurately and efficiently detecting probable mood changes in individuals at risk for depression. To resolve these challenges, we then propose a BERT-based sentimental analysis model adapted for depression-related text. Current methods for screening for traditional depression and established sentiment analysis models are hindered by data scarcity, data imbalance, and the problems of deriving emotional changes in a dynamic and clean manner. To leverage the strengths of BERTs in our model, we train the last layer of BERTs and then construct a classification layer tailored to the depressive emotion, which is more sensitive to the semantic information of the mood. Moreover, we also present data augmentation in its simplest form, which is the rearrangement of positive samples to increase the diversity of samples while still preserving the semantic meaning. To tackle data imbalance, we introduce a dynamic weight mechanism to the BCEWithLogitsLoss function by adjusting the weight of the positive samples with data distribution. The model effectively captures the complex emotional changes by combining global and local semantic dynamic representations. In our empirical study, we analyze the open-source dataset of interview transcripts of 162 volunteers. Our model is evaluated using the experimental results, and the precision, the recall rate, and the F1 score obtained are 0.667, 0.667, and 0.667, respectively. Our model has achieved 2.62 higher in terms of precision and F1 score as compared to the existing models. The results indicate that our model provides a big benefit in identifying screened individuals at risk for depression.},

abstract = {Reactive synthesis, or simply synthesis, is primarily used to automatically generate control-intensive programs. Applications of reactive synthesis span various domains, including robot motion planning, autonomous system control, and communication protocol development. This paper investigates the reactive synthesis for formulas expressed in Real-Time Linear Dynamic Logic over finite traces (RTLDLf). RTLDLf is more expressive than Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces (LTLf). While RTLDLf and Linear Dynamic Logic over finite traces (LDLf) share equivalent expressive power, RTLDLf offers greater simplicity in its logical constructs compared to LDLf. Existing synthesis methods for LDLf predominantly rely on automata-based approaches. In this paper, we propose an RTLDLf synthesis method based on temporal testers. We first translate an RTLDLf specification into a temporal tester, a non-deterministic transducer. The tester is then transformed into a graph game between the system and the environment. We finally propose a symbolic algorithm to solve the game to derive a winning strategy for the system player. The proposed method has two advantages: (1) high composability, enabling convenient and efficient synthesis of complex RTLDLf formulas, and (2) symbolic representation of the tester's transition relations and state space, which facilitates the use of efficient symbolic algorithms based on Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams.},

By replacing the loss function in the final Softmax layer of the EfficientNet model, the ability to extract image features for binary classification problems has been enhanced, resulting in improved model performance. The experimental results show that this method can effectively identify various DDoS attacks.

abstract = {Existing multimodal knowledge graph reasoning methods often rely on simple weighted averaging or attention mechanisms for multimodal feature fusion, which frequently results in the loss of modality-specific information and fails to fully exploit the complementary relationships between modalities. To address these issues, this paper proposes a multimodal knowledge graph reasoning method based on a cross-attention mechanism. The model employs the BERT model to encode textual information, introduces a VGG-16 model with a multi-scale attention module to encode visual information, and utilizes a graph attention mechanism to extract the structural information of the knowledge graph. Additionally, a contrastive learning framework is introduced to reduce semantic inconsistencies between modalities, and a cross-attention mechanism is used to achieve dynamic feature fusion across modalities. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, comparative experiments were conducted on the FB15k-237 and DB15K datasets. The results show that the proposed model significantly outperforms existing benchmark models on key evaluation metrics such as MRR, Hit@1, Hit@3, and Hit@10, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in multimodal knowledge graph reasoning.},

abstract = {Medical image analysis is essential for accurate disease diagnosis, with multimodal imaging offering complementary information to enhance diagnostic precision. However, current GAN architectures exhibit limitations in feature fusion efficiency, synthesized image quality, and classification accuracy. In this study, a GAN-based multimodal medical image generation and classification model was constructed. First, features are extracted using multi-scale receptive fields, key channels are enhanced by combining the channel attention mechanism, and the cross-enhanced fusion module realizes the fusion of MRI and PET features. In addition, Generator 3D is responsible for generating realistic medical images and classifying diseases through the classification header. Discriminator 3D is used to discriminate the realism of the images. Meanwhile, a comprehensive loss function is designed to optimize the generator's performance by combining adversarial loss, correlation loss, mean loss, and classification loss. The experimental results show that the proposed method can generate high-quality medical images and perform well on the classification task. It effectively improves the performance of medical image analysis and provides strong support for clinical diagnosis.},

abstract = {Crime prediction serves as a fundamental basis for preventing crime, maintaining social stability, and ensuring public safety. Current crime prediction models commonly suffer from issues such as low accuracy, unstable predictions, or weak generalization capabilities. Therefore, we constructed an improved LSTM crime prediction model based on environmental factors, integrated the data of various environmental factors such as economy, culture and climate, improved the LSTM network structure and optimization method, and enhanced the prediction ability of crime in the region. Empirical evidence shows that the MAPE predicted by the model is 0.0491 and R2 is 0.9229. Compared with the traditional model, the accuracy, stability and generalization ability of the prediction are significantly improved, which can provide a basis for the formulation of crime prevention and control strategies, improve the level of social security management, and promote social stability.},

The experimental results demonstrate that the LLM's shortcomings in command relation understanding can be supplemented by external models to generate promising templates. We do not rule out the contribution of validators to property-specific consistency. However, our framework aims to preserve the large language model generation capability while focusing on the implicit relationships in configurations. By introducing a hierarchical command graph, we follow a top-down matching to generate templates, reducing feedback interactions in generation and bring potential solutions for automated provisioning. We process template generation under different scenarios, including establishing BGP basic connections on multiple routers and imposing restrictions such as route redistribution at specific locations. Human involvement is restricted to providing critical information. Experiment shows that expected templates can be generated in the first iteration, particularly for the basic task. The advanced task is influenced by multiple factors, however, it still shows considerable potential in terms of coverage with possibly feasible templates.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of the Internet and the exponential growth of network information resources, how to help users quickly obtain valuable information has become a major challenge. As the key technology of this problem, recommendation algorithm has become an important tool in the information age. However, most existing recommendation systems, such as traditional deep learning recommendation algorithms, still have problems such as cold start of new users and improper handling of dynamic changes in user behavior. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a fusion Group behavior characteristics and time series characteristics of the recommendation algorithm model Group-Temporal Recommendation Fusion (GTRF). Based on deep learning algorithm, the model extracts group behavioral characteristics by using graph attention network to deal with the problem of cold start, obtains time series characteristics by using gated convolution and GRU to deal with the problem of dynamic changes in user behavior, and finally uses cross-attention mechanism to effectively integrate these two types of features to achieve high-precision prediction of recommended content. GTRF not only solves the problems such as cold start of new users and dynamic change of user behavior, but also significantly improves the comprehensive performance of recommendation algorithm, showing the indispensable and great potential of recommendation algorithm in information retrieval.},

Traditional approaches, such as GPT-4o and chain-of-thought (CoT) frameworks, having low accuracy or efficiency. To better solve these problems, this paper introduces Dynamic Semantic Structure Rule Constrained Adversarial Training (DSC-AT), which uses balanced semantic fidelity and steganography to enhance adversarial sample optimisation, achieving an 82\% deception rate. Meanwhile, the Semantic-Robust Unified Architecture (SRUA) scheme integrates text classification layer, logical verification layer and uncertainty detection layer to improve accuracy. Besides, to better train the model, we provide the Content Reinforcement Learning-based Tactical Adversarial Defence (RL-TAD) model simulates the interaction between the attacker and the defender, improves the training strategy by using backpropagation descent. Experimental results show that contrast to CoT, SRUA improves the detection accuracy to 92.1 percent and reduces the false alarm rate by 65 percent, which provided an efficient and flexible solution for identifying LLM-generated misinformation.},

abstract = {Emotional recognition can help machines to capture the emotional state of human beings, which is an indispensable technology for human-computer interaction and the realization of artificial intelligence. Electroencephalogram (EEG) has been applied to emotion recognition due to its good temporal and spatial resolution. How to capture the correlation of long-distance time-series EEG signal data from both temporal and spatial dimensions and directly affect the effect of emotion recognition is a difficulty in the BCI research. Transformer model can extract long-term correlations of time-series signals. In this paper, a new electroencephalogram emotion recognition method based on spatiotemporal fusion Vision Transformer is proposed. The feature of EEG signals is reconstructed by the tunable Q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT) method. The spatiotemporal correlation between the acquisition channel and the temporal signal is established by position coding for the convolved features. The hybrid model of multiscale convolutional and Vision Transformer (MC-ViT) is utilized for feature extraction and emotion classification. The EEG emotion recognition method based on spatio-temporal fusion vision transformer proposed in this paper has achieved good EEG emotion classification effect on the SEED dataset, which outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning methods.},

abstract = {Shipboard emergencies can easily induce secondary events because of any time and space transition. Carrier-based aircraft emergencies have complexity, tight coupling and strong real-time characteristics. Therefore, it is of great significance to reasonably predict the development trend of the incident in the emergency treatment to reduce the harm. Due to the sudden and random nature of naval battlefield accidents, some incidents are not covered by the historical case base. Traditional retrieval approaches to event prediction using case knowledge are limited by the sparsity of events and the cold-start problem. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-graph neural network for event development trend prediction, which disassembles events into event features and introduces the shipboard aircraft domain knowledge graph. We produce a data set around the event features of carrier-based aircraft on the simulation platform. The results show that the graph neural network with knowledge graph is superior in modeling the higher-order semantic association between event features. Compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods, our approach exhibits significant improvements.},

abstract = {This paper presents an Android certificate validation vulnerability detection framework that integrates static analysis, adversarial sample training, and optimization via large language models. Centered around the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network, the framework aims to enhance the robustness and generalization ability of static detection models against complex and obfuscated attack patterns. Static analysis is performed on 2,000 popular Android applications from the androzoo dataset, with code and configuration features extracted, focusing on certificate-related API usage, permission declarations, and network security settings. Among them, 110 APKs are identified as containing high-risk certificate misconfigurations. Based on these features, a Transformer-based model is constructed for feature vectorization and vulnerability identification. To further improve model robustness, WGAN is employed to generate adversarial samples that mimic real-world evasive vulnerabilities, which are used for adversarial training. Additionally, large language models are used to perform In-Context Learning, enabling semantic filtering, sample refinement, and iterative generator feedback. This results in a closed-loop, self-improving detection pipeline that combines detection, optimization, and feedback. Experimental results across standard, adversarial, and cross-domain scenarios demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves an F1 score of 0.91 and reduces the false positive rate to 7.2\%, significantly outperforming traditional static detection tools in both accuracy and resilience.},

First, a new residual hybrid attention module (RHAB) is constructed, which is serially combined with multiple self-attention (MSA) to enhance feature extraction by mixing channel attention (CA), spatial attention (SA), and MSA, and to improve the model's ability in modeling locally and globally relevant information. Second, a spatial-gate feed-forward network (SGFN) is used instead of the multilayer perceptron (MLP) in the original network to effectively reduce redundant channel information, overcome the limitations of the MLP in dealing with local spatial features, and enhance the feature expression efficiency. The experiments use NWPU-RESISC45 and UCMerced_LandUse as the training set, RSOD-Dataset, RSSCN7 Data Set, and WHU-RS19 Data Set as the test set, and the model performance is evaluated by PSNR and SSIM metrics.

abstract = {Due to its easy-to-use characteristic, passwords are still the main way to authenticate a person online. However, as the increasing number of websites, users now often come across the issues of password overload. Such repeated use of one's passwords or choosing simple passwords such as names or dates could lead to serious security risks. Password-guessing simulations could effectively prevent these vulnerabilities. Nowadays, most modern websites request passwords with special characters to enhance their complexity. This study emphasizes the special characters within passwords. By using t-SNE visualization and KL divergence, we have analyzed the distribution of these characters among different passwords visually and quantitatively. As the result shows, special characters present a unique distribution mode in t-SNE visualization, with a higher KL divergence value than alphabetic and digit segments. Based on our findings, a password-guessing approach that classified the special character segments into four types according to the position named the Pos-PCFG model has been proposed. The model has improved the guessing accuracy of multiple datasets. In the Rockyou dataset test, accuracy was achieved with a notable 0.98\% increase when guessing passwords consisting of special characters.},
