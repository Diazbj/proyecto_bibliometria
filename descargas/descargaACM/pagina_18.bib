abstract = {Generative AI has emerged as a transformative technology capable of reshaping public sector operations by streamlining administrative tasks, enhancing data analytics, and driving more personalized citizen interactions. Despite its potential, a critical gap remains in understanding how generative AI can be effectively integrated into government processes, particularly in developing countries like Indonesia, where bureaucratic inefficiencies and infrastructural constraints persist. This study addresses this gap by conducting a mixed-method investigation that combines a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of generative AI applications across multiple sectors to inform public service innovation, with expert interviews from key stakeholders Indonesian government, academic, and industry. The findings indicate that generative AI holds substantial promise for reducing manual processes, improving inter-agency coordination, and fostering data-driven decision-making. However, challenges related to ethical considerations, data privacy, and limited digital infrastructure present significant barriers to widespread adoption. By proposing a governance framework and offering strategic recommendations tailored to the Indonesian context, this research provides actionable insights for policymakers, government agencies, and technology providers. In doing so, it contributes to the evolving discourse on AI-driven public service innovation and offers a pathway toward realizing a more efficient and citizen-focused smart government in Indonesia.},

abstract = {With the development of artificial intelligence technology, generative AI models such as GPT are now increasingly used in education. Studies have found that these models have great potential in improving students' innovation ability, especially in cultivating students' creative thinking and problem-solving abilities. However, we found that the current traditional teaching methods are still somewhat lacking in cultivating students' innovation and creativity. For example, many students are not well prepared and answer questions when facing complex real-life problems. This time, our research mainly wants to see whether the tasks designed based on GPT can effectively improve undergraduate students' creativity. At the same time, we use the support vector machine (SVM) model for quantitative evaluation. We designed four specific tasks to examine students' performance from the core dimensions of innovation, namely creative thinking, problem solving, knowledge integration, and teamwork. The experimental results show that GPT has a significant effect on improving students' creative thinking (task one) and problem solving (task two), especially in the problem-solving task. We also compared the scores predicted by the model with the actual scores and found that the two were very consistent, which shows that GPT can indeed help students better diverge their thinking and analyze problems. In addition, this study also verified the feasibility of using support vector machines to quantitatively evaluate students' innovation ability. In general, GPT combined with machine learning models such as SVM may become a valuable tool in the future in improving students' creativity, problem-solving ability, and even overall innovation performance.},

abstract = {Project Based Learning (PBL) is a constructivist educational method. It addresses real-world problems and drives the learning process through collaborative exploration and iterative thinking among students. It shifts the educational goal from rote memorization of knowledge to the generation and development of abilities. However, PBL still faces many challenges in teaching implementation, mainly including three aspects: personalized project design, dynamic process guidance, and refined evaluation feedback. With the acceleration of digital transformation in education and the development of Large Scale Models technology, applying Generative AI to PBL will provide assistance for its effective implementation. Generative AI can assist in optimizing teaching project design, support personalized exploration processes for students, and achieve multi-dimensional ability assessment of students. At present, the application of Generative AI in PBL is in the exploratory stage. This article deconstructs the application of Generative AI in project design, implementation, and evaluation. Then, taking the exchange network construction teaching project as an example, it proposes the prompt language design of Generative AI in PBL teaching project design. Finally, it analyzes the potential risks brought by Generative AI. This study provides an implementation model and example for intelligent innovation in PBL.},

abstract = {The emergence of generative and procedural art marks a fundamental shift in creative practice, where the traditional “art-object” (painting, sculpture…) transforms into an “art-subject” paradigm that challenges temporal assumptions about design and futurity. As computational systems evolve beyond mere extensions of human memory and processing capacity, they demonstrate a unique form of creativity that can be characterized as “imachination”—a term that captures the machine’s distinctive approach to creative synthesis, which parallels yet diverges from normative human imagination.This transformation necessitates a reconceptualization of artistic skills and creative agency. While traditional artistic mastery centered on manual dexterity and technical craftsmanship (tekhn\`{e} vs tekhn\`{e}), contemporary practice reveals that manual execution may have restricted the creative process to a temporally and spatially contained form or reification. We may consider that, until the 19th century, the art-object has restrained the canonic practice to using hands as a constraint imposed by the inability to directly project mental concepts through the eyes. Assuming with Leonardo that “la pittura\`{e} cosa mentale”, the art-object translates into the interruption, at a highly specific moment of the mental process putting a full stop to its dynamic expression. Temporality becomes a good way to understand the outcomes of generative media. While the traditional practice focusses on the trace left by the brush stroke or the chisel print in marble, the evidence of “what happened” frozen in time (Roland Barthes’ “\c{C}a a\'{e}t\'{e}” (in La chambre claire), reversely, generative and processual artworks are designed for “what they will come”. Metaphorically we could say that one is the hundred millions years old petrified tree, the other is the seed of promises, thoroughly designed by the artist to open up fields of virtuality. The temporal switch is striking and it doesn’t affect only the artwork, but also the artist forced to reconsider one’s practice.The advent of collective (Pierre Levy) and connective (Derrick de Kerckhove) intelligence introduces creativity models based on unlimited repositories of historical references. This creates a fundamental paradox: we expect creativity to forge new pathways while simultaneously grounding it in comprehensive analysis of existing patterns. The limitations of traditional IQ-based assessments of logical-mathematical intelligence become apparent in this context, neurotypical thinking is a highly normative conception of human thought, and neurodivergent thinking patterns—characterized by rapid, non-linear connections across conceptual spaces—may provide more accurate models for understanding how imachination operates.During this talk, I will present original case studies exploring the conceptual territory of human-machine creative interweaving. Through the definition of conceptual building blocks such as iterative curatorship, egonomy, extended serendipity, critical fusion, artificial intentionality, and maieutic engines, this essay shed light on how human creative role will evolve, not competing with artificial intelligence, but through new forms of human-machine symbiosis that expand the boundaries of creative possibilities, while presenting to the human kind a magic mirror to see its true colors.The investigation draws upon the ancient concept of clinamen–the random disruption of the flow of particles that generates diversity in atomic systems–as a metaphor for understanding how creative divergence functions in both human neurodivergence and artificial intelligence systems. By following these “lines of steepest slope” through the latent spaces of machine learning, we can better comprehend the emerging landscape of augmented creativity and its implications for future artistic practice.},

An inductive analysis of notes from sessions resulted in a data structure with the following aggregate dimensions: 1.) privacy and safety; 2.) managing content; 3.) developmental, physical, and behavioral impacts; 4.) broad concerns about emerging technologies; 5.) balancing XR and reality; and 6.) contextual considerations. We include details on each of these aggregate dimensions as well as a grounded model derived from them, providing examples of how these dimensions interact with each other to influence stakeholder perspectives on the ethics of specific uses of XR.},

The purpose of this research is to investigate social norms, expectations, and standards of the elderly population for improving trust relationships while interacting with generative AI. The study is based on the CASA paradigm to gain a better understanding of the trust dynamics in human-computer communication to improve the adoption of GAI for elders' health and well-being. We validated the conceptual model with empirical data from 287 elderly users collected through an online and offline survey tool. Quantitative responses received were analysed using structural equation modeling. The study highlights how multimodal interaction, empathy, personalization, augmentation, bias stereotyping, and privacy and security affect the extent to which elderly consumers perceive GAI as trustworthy. Findings indicate that multimodal interaction, personalization, augmentation, and bias stereotyping significantly influenced the trust relationship between the elderly population and GAI. However, empathy privacy, and security were found to be insignificant in trust relationships. Further trust relationships significantly impacted GAI usage. The research provides strong theoretical and practical implications as all the stakeholders like healthcare professionals, patients/users, caregivers, and technology developers can be involved in building applications that cater to diverse needs and promote positive social interactions that can enhance GAI trust and usage.},

In this study, we examined how people feel about AI-generated fan art and AI-generated music covers of their favorite musical artists. Through an online survey (N=200) we explored how parasocial relationships with their favorite musicians and self-determination factors of autonomy, competence, and relatedness were associated with attitudes towards AI-generated fan content. Parasocial relationships were positively associated, but when these intrinsic values were taken into consideration, participants’ sense of choice in controlling what they see on social media was the only factor that explained favorable sentiments towards AI-generated fan content.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is positively grasped as promising to disrupt the higher education system but it also poses a number of challenges. Although so many studies attempt to explore the matching of the possibility of this growing technology with the higher education system, ample research needs to be conducted to solve the challenges facing the renovation of higher education. With this in mind, our aim of bibliometric studies is to conduct a deep investigation into the increasingly developing scenario of Generative AI tools in higher education. We extracted data from the Web of Science database that is up-to-date till July 2024, comprising 934 relevant articles. Co-citation and co-word analyses revealed three main research clusters: advanced computationable methods, AI application in higher education, and user technology and adoption. The findings illustrated rapid diffusion of generative AI technologies with prominent emphasis on large-language models in pedagogical practices. Other critical themes center around developing AI-facilitated learning interventions, ethical challenges, and usage impact on learning outcomes. The results show that the field is inherently interdisciplinary, using ideas from educational technology, cognitive science, and AI. In addition, a rising trend is noted for the focus on academic honesty and users' involvement with AI devices. The results indicate the important implications of this study for teachers and policymakers alongside contributions to teaching and research that offer a guide to sustainable improvement across education. Future research would benefit from longitudinal studies drawing on an interdisciplinary approach to realize the long-term implications and address complex issues surrounding the integration of AI within universities.},

abstract = {Cooperation between the United States and China, the world’s leading artificial intelligence (AI) powers, is crucial for effective global AI governance and responsible AI development. Although geopolitical tensions have emphasized areas of conflict, in this work, we identify potential common ground for productive dialogue by conducting a systematic analysis of more than 40 primary AI policy and corporate governance documents from both nations. Specifically, using an adapted version of the AI Governance and Regulatory Archive (AGORA) — a comprehensive repository of global AI governance documents — we analyze these materials in their original languages to identify areas of convergence in (1) sociotechnical risk perception and (2) governance approaches. We find strong and moderate overlap in several areas such as on concerns about algorithmic transparency, system reliability, agreement on the importance of inclusive multi-stakeholder engagement, and AI’s role in enhancing safety. These findings suggest that despite strategic competition, there exist concrete opportunities for bilateral U.S.-China cooperation in the development of responsible AI. Thus, we present recommendations for furthering diplomatic dialogues that can facilitate such cooperation. Our analysis contributes to understanding how different international governance frameworks might be harmonized to promote global responsible AI development.},

abstract = {Aiming at the problem that the “single-dimension” teaching effect evaluation, which is mainly based on the result evaluation, cannot effectively evaluate the students' learning effect in the online and offline teaching mode, we constructed a “competence-oriented multi-dimension teaching effect evaluation model”. Based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), the model constructs a competence evaluation system with four evaluation dimensions: self learning, hands-on practice, innovative thinking and collaborative learning to evaluate students' learning effects. The weights of the indicators at all levels were calculated by AHP, and the competence evaluation model was constructed based on machine learning and validated to ensure the scientificity and rationality of the evaluation. Taking the Data Structure and Algorithms course as a practical case, relying on diversified online teaching platforms, course knowledge map and AI tools, we collect students' learning process data through multiple channels, and utilize the model to conduct a multi-dimensional and comprehensive evaluation of students' learning effects. The research and practice show that the model provides powerful data support for the evaluation and improvement of students' practical ability, comprehensive quality and personalized learning effect.},

abstract = {This study focuses on the satisfaction of Intelligent Customer Service (ICS) with the application of generative AI technology in e-commerce. In the context of the rapid development of information technology, e-commerce platforms actively use and explore innovative applications of ICS to improve user shopping experience. Exploring the user's acceptance and satisfaction of ICS is still an important topic in current research and practice. This study combined Customer Satisfaction Barometer (CSB) and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), collected data through questionnaire survey, and then used K-means clustering algorithm to cluster data to identify different behaviors and preference patterns of users when using ICS. Then, CHAID algorithm is used in each cluster to dig deeply into the key factors affecting users' acceptance of ICS, and then obtain the key factors of user satisfaction and their interaction relationship. Research data showed that Cronbach's Alpha=0.874 and KMO=0.8. The results show that a stable, reliable, accurate, efficient, intuitive understanding and caring ICS system is the key to improving user satisfaction.},

abstract = {The landscape of artificial intelligence (AI) has experienced a monumental shift with the emerging of Generative AI (GenAI), which has demonstrated to be a transformative tool across diverse sectors. GenAI outputs can span various digital formats, including text, images, videos, and audio, generating particular interest in the public sector. The growing interest of governments in integrating GenAI technologies in public sector operations is marked by the creation of emerging governance instruments and the formulation of soft laws, like standards, principles, and guidelines. This study aims to delve into the intricacies and potential risks associated with the deployment of GenAI within government. Through a qualitative content analysis, the research meticulously examines GenAI usage guidelines issued by Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and South Korea. The objective is to discern the risks acknowledged by these countries' soft laws and compare them with the risks identified by scholars in the field. The performed comparative analysis across countries suggest that the use of GenAI in the public sector raises common risks such as information leakage, data privacy, security, and concerns over public trust. By elucidating the varied risk perceptions across different national contexts, this study provides theoretical and practical implications related to the risks of GenAI within the public sector. Moreover, it sets a foundation for future research and policy development, ensuring that generative AI is used as a force for good in public governance.},

More specifically, we would like to discuss ethical aspects related to motivations for research, how research is conducted, and how it is reported. We hope these discussions will go well beyond legal requirements from ethics boards and help provide foundational guidance for research on emerging technologies with children, but also inform similar research with other vulnerable communities.},

Using photographs recovered from historical archives, images that documented everyday reality (1900-1930), AI is integrated into the creative process to offer a speculative prediction of the moments captured in silver gelatin. Apparently, they are fictitious recreations generated by AI, however, the piece visually explores, from the generated story, the intersubjective mechanisms in which we build our historical memory. It is a dialogue with the past to develop a story of the future recreated by an algorithm that has been fed by collective imaginaries. A technology that allows us to observe not only the shadows projected in the cave, but also the fire that generates them, the objects that create these shadows and the forces that control the experience.},

abstract = {Mental Health (MH) is fundamental to overall well-being, yet Mental Health Literacy (MHL) remains low despite growing awareness. Many individuals feel uncomfortable discussing MH due to persistent stigma, leading to misconceptions, discrimination, and reluctance to seek help. Reducing stigma requires education and open dialogue. Games have been widely recognized as effective tools for learning, and digital platforms increasingly play a role in MH interventions by offering engaging, interactive experiences. Similarly, Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, are being adopted across various domains for answering questions and facilitating learning. However, when it comes to sensitive topics like MH, users may hesitate to engage with AI-driven models or be unaware of the proper ways to ask questions to the model. Moreover, the potential of AI-powered game agents in MH educational context remains largely unexplored. My research investigates the design of interventions that integrate game-based learning with AI-driven conversational agents as Non-Player Characters (NPC) to promote awareness of MH, encourage self-reflection, and reduce stigma. Using a Research Through Design approach, I develop and evaluate prototypes where users engage with games and a chatbot to explore MH topics. The findings aim to contribute to the "Artifacts and Systems" domain by providing insights into designing effective and engaging digital MH interventions.},

abstract = {ChatGPT potential value in education is broadly recognized and many studies report experiments of its use inside or outside the classroom by students and teachers. On the other hand, the use of ChatGPT rises lots of concerns about well-known problems such as hallucination, plagiarism, overreliance, or misinformation. It is of primary importance to teach students a correct and constructive use of ChatGPT and a critical approach to its returned outputs. The paper presents a classroom experience where students were asked to interact with ChatGPT in the context of a database course. The declared challenge for the students was, given a set of predefined relational database schemata, to invent questions for ChatGPT and try to force wrong SQL solutions. Students had to record the question, the ChatGPT solution, their solution, and the comments about the eventual ChatGPT syntactical and/or semantical errors. This gamification approach was meant to enhance students' motivation, but the main teachers' goal was to make them reflect critically (i) on ChatGPT output, experiencing that it does make mistakes, (ii) on the interpretation of ChatGPT errors, and (iii) on the possible strategies for forcing ChatGPT errors. The experiment involved 166 B.S. students in Engineering and the collected data have been analyzed under different points of view to get an insight into the approach and the critical attitude of the students. The paper reports the results of this analysis and discusses the impact of the activity on learning by analyzing the correlation between students' participation and exam performance.},

abstract = {We live in a time when unprecedented technological abundance stands in a perplexingly stark contrast to a precarious future, declining mental health and increasing disengagement from work. Past work has emphasized positive user experiences as a desirable design goal in designing interactive systems. Yet, researchers argue that to flourish, we need to cultivate phronesis, or practical wisdom which results from a successful integration of virtues, or character strengths. The design of technology embeds value judgments about what is worthwhile, and to the extent that interactive technologies can both positively and negatively shape our decisions, influence our motivations, and form our habits, the question arises: how can we design them to help us inculcate those patterns of thought and behavior which contribute to our ability to use technological affordances prudently and cultivate well-being supportive virtues? The aim of this one day in-person workshop is to bring together researchers to deepen our understanding of the overlap between design, flourishing and the role of virtues, and develop fruitful avenues for further research and collaboration.},
