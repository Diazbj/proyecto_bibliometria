The conference program includes plenary lectures, paper sessions, panels, tips, techniques \&amp; courseware demonstrations, posters, a doctoral consortium, and working group presentations. Working groups meet from 27 to 29 June and will submit draft reports before the conference begins on 30 June.The program includes two keynote talks by scholars from neighbouring disciplines, to help the community explore new challenges and reflect on scientific progress in the field. Our opening speaker, Inge Molenaar, will present her views about 'Human-AI Collaboration in Education: The Hybrid Future'. At the end of the conference, Danny Beckers will address the conference in a plenary session with a talk entitled 'On the Connection between Blind Dates and Teaching Programming'.Reviewing of submissions for ITiCSE 2025 involved 323 researchers and practitioners from computing education and related fields, including 38 programme committee members. Thanks to their outstanding effort and commitment, every submission received a metareview and most received at least three reviews, providing authors of all submissions with constructive feedback. Although no review process is flawless, we are confident that this effort led to a vibrant conference program, capturing multiple voices and perspectives in the field.We received 354 full paper submissions for the conference. The programme committee worked very hard to select 99 papers to be presented at ITiCSE 2025 and published in the proceedings. The proceedings also include the opening keynote abstract, 23 tips, techniques, \&amp; courseware submissions, and abstracts for 9 working groups, 3 panels, 45 posters, and 16 doctoral consortium participants.},

abstract = {Welcome to the 16th ACM/SPEC International Conference of Performance Engineering (ICPE), held in Toronto, Canada, from May 5, 2025, to May 9, 2025. ICPE serves as the premier global forum for showcasing and discussing new concepts, innovations, trends, and experiences in performance engineering.On May 5 and 6, the first two days of the conference, we scheduled five workshops and two tutorials. The workshops cover important topics in performance engineering today. These include cloud computing (HotCloudPerf 2025) and its benchmarking (BID 2025), the benchmarking and load testing of software systems (LTB 2025), performance engineering in the Large Language Models (AIPerfLLM 2025), and the application of performance engineering in both educational and practical contexts (WEPPE 2025). We thank the workshop chairs, Luca Trani and Marios Fokaefs, for arranging a great workshop agenda. On May 5, we have a tutorial on serverless computing entitled "Serverless Orchestration on the Edge-Cloud Continuum: Challenges and Solutions," authored by Reza Farahing and Radu Prodan, while May 6 is dedicated to energy-efficiency benchmarking with the tutorial conducted by Maximilian Meissner, Klaus-Dieter Lange, Aaron Cragin, and Diego Esteves, called "Next Generation Energy-Efficiency Benchmarking - Reliable and Reproducible Efficiency Testing in a Diverse IT-Landscape" and to a hands-on session with the Kieker 2 Observability Framework, authored by Shinhyung Yang, David Georg Reichelt, Reiner Jung, Marcel Hansson, and Wilhelm Hasselbring. We express our gratitude to the tutorial chairs, Vittoria de Nitto Person\`{e} and Cristina Abad, for organizing such engaging tutorial session.The main conference occurs from May 7 to May 9, with each day starting with a keynote that we are excited to welcome. Lizy John opens May 7 from the University of Texas (USA), who shares insights on AI for Performance Engineering and Performance Engineering for AI, while we host Ahmed Hassan from Queen's University (Canada) on May 8, who emphasizes the importance of software performance engineering on Foundation Models. Marc Brooker from AWS, USA, presents different approaches to performance engineering during bad times, such as during and after overload and failures.The program features many research presentations spanning various tracks, including Research, Industry, Emerging Research, Artifacts, Data Challenges, Posters, and Demos. The Research track features 24 presentations, while the Industry track, chaired by Lishan Yang and Alex Podelko (a big thank you to both of them!), includes eight papers. This year, the main conference is enriched by five presentations from the Industry Presentation Track, a showcase for industrial contributors to share their insights and experiences on performance engineering.We accepted 3 submissions in the Emerging Research track and 2 papers in the Artifact Evaluation, Data Challenge, Poster and Demo tracks, respectively. Thank you, Ana Lucia Varbanescu and Y.C. Tay, for your invaluable expertise in guiding the Emerging Research track. We appreciate the meticulous work of Nikolas Herbst and S\"{o}ren Henning to ensure the quality and rigor of the contributions to the Artifact Evaluation track, as well as the efforts of Emilio Incerto for the Poster and Demo track, and Andr\'{e} Bauer and Naser Ezzati-Jivan for the Data Challenge track. ICPE25 features 3 presentations from the Journal First track, perfectly organized by Raffaela Mirandola and Weiyi (Ian) Shang.This year conference recognizes three of the pioneers of software performance engineering, Connie Smith, Dorina Petriu, Murray Woodside. Thank you Antinisca Di Marco for organizing a panel to hear their views on the past, present and future of software performance.We want to express our gratitude to the rest of the organizing committee for their hard work in organizing this edition of ICPE.

We are excited to gather in San Jose, Costa Rica, and host a hybrid event that allows remote participation from community members worldwide.As in previous years, CSCW 2024 brings together a variety of disciplines, from system design to critical analysis, to propose, examine, and reimagine technologies that support groups and communities. As our discipline evolves, new topics continuously emerge and are embraced by our community. This year, we see an emphasis on issues centered around AI, including explainability, fairness, and AI-human collaboration. At the same time, our long-standing concerns remain well represented, including work on group dynamics and decision-making, social media, inclusive and culturally aware design, co-design with marginalized communities, and the creation of socially responsible tools. This year, we invited 387 PACM-HCI, TSC, and TOCHI papers to be presented alongside a diverse lineup of workshops, posters, demos, SIGs, panels, and the doctoral consortium.

The PACT conference series brings together researchers from computer architectures, compilers, execution environments, programming languages, and applications, to share and discuss their latest research findings. This year's program showcases a wide range of topics, from classic parallel programming languages, compiles, reconfigurable parallelism, to distributed, heterogeneous architectures, in-memory computing, and architectures for AI. Additionally, PACT'24 introduced an exciting new focus on quantum and neuromorphic computing, exploring these areas both as applications and tools for architectures and compilers. In addition to the regular research papers, PACT 2024 features a special category of papers called "tools and practical experiences" (TPE). These papers emphasize applicability, such as traditional methods employed in emerging fields, aiming to highlight the challenges and experiences faced by the industry as opportunities to guide future research.},
