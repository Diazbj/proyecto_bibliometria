abstract = {Artificial Intelligence is transforming the news eco-system at a rapid pace. Large Language Models have emerged and facilitate producing content in larger quantities and with less skill or technical oversight. At the same time, media organizations struggle to maintain public trust as misinformation and disinformation continue to spread. The 11th International Workshop on News Recommendation and Analytics (INRA) serves as a venue for exchanging ideas, discussing recent developments, and important issues concerning news. We welcome contributions as scientific articles, demonstrations, and innovative ideas or citicism. Our goal is to bring together both academia and practitioners to address vital challenges facing the media world. The workshop gives attendees the chance to learn about ongoing research, discuss technical as well as ethical aspects of personalization, and contemplate about how technology, in particular Artificial Intelligence, will affect the way humans engage with news. Topics of interest include Large Language Models, advances in news personalization, mis- and disinformation, and user experience.},

abstract = {Artists have been raising the alarm about unfair and opaque practices of generative AI models for nearly two years. In a technological attempt to answer these concerns, concept erasing has promised to give artists more agency in determining whether new generative AI models get to clone their signature artistic styles. The idea behind this method is simple: take an already trained AI model, choose an artist’s style to remove from the model, and apply minimal changes to suppress that concept. Simple integration into existing pipelines makes it a particularly appealing solution. However, the efficacy of this method has so far been examined for only one artist’s style at a time. This paper, thus, examines concept erasing at scale, simulating the hypothetical application of this technology for simultaneously erasing many artists. It finds that the method does not reliably erase the concepts in cases with more than one artist’s style, highlighting a gap in the technology and the literature around it.},

Through two experiments, this study explores how reliance on GenAI affects cognitive depletion, identity reflection, prompting behaviors, and attitudes toward created content and GenAI, emphasizing the risk of uncritical trust in AI-generated content due to cognitive fatigue. Study 1 employed a Be-task to deplete cognitive resources, revealing that user involvement in writing enhances perceived identity reflection, which leads to greater persistence in unsolvable tasks and higher credibility and behavioral trust in AI. Study 2, using an email-writing task with greater ecological validity, showed the effect of user involvement on credibility. Practically, these findings suggest that AI interfaces should balance cognitive assistance with fostering user agency. Promoting active user engagement in content creation can improve credibility and trust while mitigating over-reliance on AI.},

abstract = {Technical and ethical aspects of Computer Science (CS) are interdependent. Many CS departments teach ethical and social implications of technology in separate standalone courses. However, prior research shows that ethical issues are better taught in tandem with their related technical content as an integral required skill in CS curricula. In this experience report, we share our experience with embedding ethics assignments in 3 CS courses at different levels: a CS2 course in software design and data structures, a CS3 course in data structures and algorithms, and a Software Engineering capstone course, all taught at Virginia Tech (a large public R1 institution) in Spring 2024. Students from the 3 courses were surveyed at the beginning and end of Spring 2024. By comparing results from the pre and post surveys, we found that the embedded assignments for the CS2 and CS3 courses improved students' confidence in their knowledge about how ethical issues may come into play in their career, their confidence in their ability to address ethical issues arising from applying technology in real contexts, and their confidence in communicating and defending their positions on how to address these issues. For all 3 courses, students gave positive feedback on how the assignments were engaging and relevant to the course, and how it improved their ability in raising, and reasoning about, ethical implications of technology. We believe that the practices and results of our experience will be helpful to other CS instructors thinking of injecting ethical content into their technical courses.},

abstract = {In recent years, the rapid development and the various applications of artificial intelligence technology has been gradually replacing many labor-intensive and creative tasks. Traditional design education in schools invests considerable time in cultivating students' basic skills in using techniques, tools, materials, etc., but overlooks the wave which has been brought by artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence has surpassed human performance in specific fields and is poised to replace the work of many laborers. As artificial intelligence technology advances, its applications will permeate more areas, including thinking and creative abilities that humans have taken pride in. Design education in universities should re-examine the design values of human designers and artificial intelligence respectively. This redefinition of values implies that the abilities required of designers need to be reframed. Design education in universities should also explore how to integrate artificial intelligence-related technologies into current design curricula. New design courses must manifest the value of human designers. Furthermore, design programs offered by universities should begin planning training courses on collaborative design with artificial intelligence and establish relevant mechanisms for making artificial intelligence an effective tool to assist designers. In addition to redefining the value of designers and planning artificial intelligence-assisted design courses, design departments should monitor industry trends and gather year-by-year feedback to provide students with up-to-date career development advice. We should recognize the crisis that artificial intelligence presents to current design education and address the impact of this wave on design students. Artificial intelligence is progressing toward an irreversible trend, and the growth and transformation of designers will become a new challenge for future design education.},

However, analytical methods to study the impact of this approach are not readily available for high performance computing use cases. In this position paper, we propose isoefficiency as an approach to analytically demonstrate the classes of algorithms that would benefit from disaggregated memory technologies as we scale to a larger number of processors. Isoefficiency of an algorithm is given by a function N(p) that measures the degree to which the problem size needs to increase with p (number of processors) to maintain a constant efficiency. We evaluate isoefficiency using sparse general matrix–matrix multiplication (SpGEMM) on a 2-socket shared-memory system and the simulation of a CXL-based disaggregated system. Our results support the suitability of isoefficiency for evaluating disaggregated memory systems with different design choices in conjunction with different application kernels.},

As a result, information technology teachers are confronted with the challenge of restructuring their subject knowledge and developing intelligent literacy. In the context of applying AI to basic education, intelligent literacy has become an essential professional skill for IT teachers. This paper proposes a framework for cultivating intelligent literacy among information technology teachers based on Artificial Intelligence Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (AI-TPACK) theory. The study aims to elucidate the meaning of AI-TPACK for information technology teachers, establish AI-TPACK models and practice paths for them, propose strategies for integrating subject teaching knowledge with artificial intelligence technology, and enhance cultivation and development plans for their intelligent literacy. The goal is to enhance the teaching abilities of information technology teachers so that they can acquire comprehensive artificial intelligence literacy in their work and better adapt to the new requirements and challenges presented by the era of AI.},

abstract = {We present SocialGenPod, a decentralised and privacy-friendly way of deploying generative AI Web applications. Unlike centralised Web and data architectures that keep user data tied to application and service providers, we show how one can use Solid - a decentralised Web specification - to decouple user data from generative AI applications. We demonstrate SocialGenPod using a prototype that allows users to converse with different Large Language Models, optionally leveraging Retrieval Augmented Generation to generate answers grounded in private documents stored in any Solid Pod that the user is allowed to access, directly or indirectly. SocialGenPod makes use of Solid access control mechanisms to give users full control of determining who has access to data stored in their Pods. SocialGenPod keeps all user data (chat history, app configuration, personal documents, etc) securely in the user's personal Pod; separate from specific model or application providers. Besides better privacy controls, this approach also enables portability across different services and applications. Finally, we discuss challenges, posed by the large compute requirements of state-of-the-art models, that future research in this area should address.

abstract = {The global ultra-wide display market is growing rapidly due to widespread consumer adoption. However, existing content, especially on TV screens, is mainly designed for lower aspect ratios like 4:3. As TVs shift towards wider formats, there’s a need to develop a method to transform legacy content and adapt to varying screen sizes. This shift holds the potential to revolutionize the content viewing experience for gamers, content creators, and streaming enthusiasts. While delivering high-quality visual content for dynamic aspect ratios remains a challenge, recent advancements in Deep Learning show promise in addressing these problems with generative approaches. Our contribution begins with a survey of prior video completion efforts, providing a foundational backdrop. We then introduce our novel solution, combining optical flow methodologies with generative latent diffusion models. These models, conditioned on an initial prompt and evolving video frame, refine content generation. We validate our approach on the DAVIS dataset, demonstrating its efficacy and robustness. In summary, our study pioneers advancements in content generation for ultra-wide displays.},

abstract = {Generative AI has the potential to scale a number of educational practices, previously limited by resources. One such instructional approach is mastery learning, a pedagogy emphasizing proficiency before progression that is highly resource (teacher time, materials) intensive. The rise of computer-based instruction offered partial solutions, tailoring student progression and automating some facets of the mastery learning process. This work in progress considers the application of large language models for content generation tailored to mastery learning. We present a paired framework for analyzing and evaluating the generated content relative to rubrics designed by the teacher. Recognizing the potential of large language models, we critically assess the potential of improving mastery-based instruction. We close our discussion by considering the applications and limitations of this approach.},

abstract = {The emergence of generative AI has become a hot topic in academia and industry. Generative AI is also gradually becoming an interaction mode between enterprises and customers, improving customer experience and influencing their continued use intention. However, there is still uncertainty as to whether users are willing to use generative AI-driven products and services for a long time. Previous studies have mostly been based on traditional industries. How to enhance users’ continued use intention from the perspective of AI has become a widely concerned issue in academia and industry.Based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Expectation Confirmation Theory (ECT), this study explores the impact of generative AI features on users’ continued use intention by improving the two paths of user perceived value and user satisfaction. 306 valid questionnaires were used, and SPSS 27.0 and SEM were used for data analysis and hypothesis testing. The results show that (1) generative AI features have a significant positive impact on users’ continued use intention; (2) user perceived value and user satisfaction play a mediating role in the relationship between generative AI features and users’ continued use intention. This finding improves users’ continued use intention of generative AI features, which is of great significance for understanding the marketing layout of generative AI for enterprises.},

Their ability to generate human-like text and ensure continuous availability facilitates the creation of interactive service chatbots aimed at enhancing customer experience and streamlining enterprise operations. Despite their potential, LLMs face critical challenges, such as a susceptibility to hallucinations and difficulties handling complex linguistic scenarios, notably code switching and dialectal variations. To address these challenges, this paper describes the design of a multilingual chatbot for Bengali-English customer service interactions utilizing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and targeted prompt engineering. This research provides valuable insights for the human-computer interaction (HCI) community, emphasizing the importance of designing systems that accommodate linguistic diversity to benefit both customers and businesses. By addressing the intersection of generative AI and cultural heterogeneity, this late-breaking work inspires future innovations in multilingual and multicultural HCI.},

However, despite the recent increase in research activity, age-relevant and inter/cross-generational aspects continue to be underrepresented in both research and commercial product design. Therefore, the overarching aim of this workshop is to increase the momentum for research within the space of hands-free, mobile, and conversational interfaces that centers on age-relevant and inter- and cross-generational interaction. For this, we plan to create an interdisciplinary space that brings together researchers, designers, practitioners, and users, to discuss and share challenges, principles, and strategies for designing such interfaces across the life span. We thus welcome contributions of empirical studies, theories, design, and evaluation of hands-free, mobile, and conversational interfaces designed with aging in mind (e.g. older adults or inter/cross-generational). We particularly encourage contributions focused on leveraging recent advances in generative AI or LLMs. Through this, we aim to grow the community of CUI researchers across disciplinary boundaries (human-computer interaction, voice and language technologies, geronto-technologies, information studies, etc.) that are engaged in the shared goal of ensuring that the aging dimension is appropriately incorporated in mobile / conversational interaction design research.},

We can identify current research hotspots and assess the depth and breadth of existing research so that we can fill the gaps in research in a timely manner. To achieve this goal, we used two software tools, Vosviewer and Citespace, to conduct a detailed multidimensional visualisation and analysis of 240 documents in the Web of Science (WoS) database since the 21st century. Our study reveals the following key findings: 1) The publication volume of the literature has shown a steady growth trend since 2000 to 2019, and has witnessed a significant increase between 2019 and 2024. Meanwhile, author groups such as Cattaneo, Alberto and Hamalainen, Raija are gradually becoming more representative scholars producing more articles.2) The field has clearly fostered three dominant research foci, which are: exploring VET based on an educational psychology perspective, approaching VET from a computer science and technology aspect, and focusing on the use of XR technology devices. 3) XR technology in vocational education and training shows a clear stage-by-stage evolution and is moving towards a deeper level of technological application. Some researchers have begun to focus on the construction of student-oriented educational models as well as teachers' acceptance and use of the technology.},

Yet, users’ understanding of how such ecosystems work remains unknown. In this paper, we investigate users’ mental models of how GenAI Chatbot Ecosystems work. This is an important question because users’ mental models guide their behaviors, including making decisions that impact their privacy. Through 21 semi-structured interviews, we uncovered users’ four mental models towards first-party (e.g., Google Gemini) and third-party (e.g., ChatGPT) GenAI Chatbot Ecosystems. These mental models centered around the role of the chatbot in the entire ecosystem. We further found that participants held a more consistent and simpler mental model towards third-party ecosystems than the first-party ones, resulting in higher trust and fewer concerns towards the third-party ecosystems. We discuss the design and policy implications based on our results.},

abstract = {Recent calls to reimagine K-12 computer science teacher education have proposed critical visions of pre-service teacher education built on equity, justice, and ethics. Building on these calls, this position paper demonstrates how critical perspectives can be incorporated into K-12 CS teacher education programs by integrating texts from Science and Technology studies. Central to this approach is allowing teachers to gain proficiency in CS content while navigating the tensions of the transformative and oppressive nature of technology as they imagine their future pedagogy. By integrating the often separated strands of pedagogy, content, and justice, pre-service teachers were empowered to reimagine what computer science would look like for their students. This paper concludes by discussing how a Science and Technology Studies approach could be used for entire course sequences in CS teacher preparation programs and preliminary feedback from teachers in the first iteration of this curriculum.},

Most interventions to counter misinformation on social media are text-based, which may lack the persuasive power of richer modalities. This study explores whether the effectiveness of misinformation correction varies by modality, and if certain modalities of misinformation are better countered by a specific correction modality. We conducted a survey-based experiment where participants rated the credibility of misinformation tweets before and after exposure to corrections, across all combinations of text, images and video modalities. Our findings suggest that corrections are most effective when their modality richness matches that of the original misinformation. We discuss factors affecting the perceived credibility of corrections and offer strategies to optimise misinformation correction.},

Recent advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence systems have nourished a renewed interest in identifying and estimating the cause-and-effect relationship from the substantial amount of available observational data. This has resulted in various new studies aimed at providing novel methods for identifying and estimating causal inference. We include a detailed taxonomy of causal inference frameworks, methods, and evaluation. An overview of causality for security is also provided. Open challenges are detailed, and approaches for evaluating the robustness of causal inference methods are described. This article aims to provide a comprehensive survey on such studies of causality.

abstract = {The basic purpose of copyright is to protect economic and moral rights. Economic rights allow the rights owners to derive financial rewards from monetizing their works. In contrast, moral rights allow the creators to be acknowledged and to take certain actions to preserve and protect the integrity of their works. Both rights are conventionally granted to human and legal entities. However, the massive advancement of AI challenges the essential presumption that technology is merely a device in the hands of humans in the creation process of Work. This paper examines several legal issues and problems concerning the economic and moral rights of AI-generated works using the juridical normative approach from the perspective of Indonesian Copyright Law. The result shows that the framework of Indonesia's copyright law is based on the principle of human authorship, therefore, moral rights can only be granted to human(s) and economic rights can only be granted to legal subjects acknowledged by Indonesian Law: human and legal entity. Although the authorship and ownership of AI for copyrighted work is contentious under Indonesian Laws, the limited legal personality of AI could potentially artifice as the preventive measures on several problems concerning legal standing by enabling legal subject (human or legal entity) to act behalf of AI to exercise their rights and obligation both based on regulative approach and procedural approach.},

However, little research has examined the impact that generative AI stands to have on African consumers and users who may be affected by its application in various fields such as education, healthcare, and social media. This work presents an early look into the implications of using generative AI within African contexts, exploring case studies of current generative AI use within Africa. These case studies examine the use of generative AI in marketing and for image and text generation. While the potential for generative AI in Africa is growing, this preliminary work aims to set a foundation for highlighting risks associated with generative AI while exploring how generative AI can be responsibly developed and used within African contexts.},

abstract = {This paper introduces TELL-ME, a prototype designed to provide personalized explanations for outputs generated by large language models (LLMs). Traditional explanation approaches often fail to address diverse user needs in understanding generative AI (GenAI) outputs. TELL-ME bridges this gap by tailoring explanations to three distinct user groups: beginners, advanced users, and experts. Two literature reviews on explanation and personalization informed the design of TELL-ME. With that, TELL-ME provides feature ablation, counterfactual, and self-explainability explanations on text generation tasks. A preliminary evaluation of TELL-ME with six participants showed that the personalized explanations enhanced users’ understanding of model outputs. Nonetheless, areas for improvement were identified, such as integrating state-of-the-art LLMs into the prototype. The full code for TELL-ME is available at https://github.com/jayjkb/TELL-ME.},

However, this presents unique challenges, including the need for effective interactive collaboration and access to diverse skill sets of members in the software development team. To address these problems, we present ''DevCoach'', an online system designed to support students learning the SDLC at scale by interacting with generative agents powered by large language models simulating members with different roles in a software development team. Our preliminary user study results reveal that DevCoach improves the experiences and outcomes for students, with regard to learning concepts in SDLC's ''Plan and Design'' and ''Develop'' phases. We aim to use our findings to enhance DevCoach to support the entire SDLC workflow by incorporating additional simulated roles and enabling students to choose their project topics. Future studies will be conducted in an online Software Engineering class at our institution, aiming to explore and inspire the development of intelligent systems that provide comprehensive SDLC learning experiences to students at scale.},

abstract = {With the advancement of digital technologies and gadgets, online content has become easily accessible by users. At the same time, harmful content also spread widely. There are different harmful content types present on various platforms in multiple languages. The topic of harmful content is broad and covers multiple research directions. In research, the different forms are mostly analyzed separately, e.g., misinformation, cyberbullying, and hate speech. Most research has been conducted for a specific platform, monolingual situation, or particular topics. Counter-measures like blocking or down-ranking can make harmful content spreaders switch platforms and languages to continuously reach a user base. Harmful content does not only appear on social media but also on news media. Spreaders share harmful content in posts, news articles, comments, and hyperlinks. There is a great need to study harmful content across platforms, languages, and topics. We plan to bring the research on harmful content under one umbrella so that different approaches and novel methods can be shared. We organized the 1st workshop on DHOW: Diffusion of Harmful Content on Online Web at WebSci 2024, which brings together research on different topics related to harmful content. We expect to discuss innovative research work and future research directions.},

abstract = {The quality of instructions is crucial for LLM (large language model) fine-tuning. The most compelling data for instruction tuning exhibit not only high complexity, low perplexity, high faithfulness, and high answer relevancy, but also diversity, naturalness, coherence, and understandability. However, traditional QAG (question and answer generation) and LLMs face challenges regarding instruction complexity, answer relevancy and diversity. To overcome these issues, we have developed the Qwen-IG instruction generation model for LLM fine-tuning. Firstly, we collect high-quality instruction sets, such as alpaca, GPT4-LLM, and TigerBot, and utilize them to build a train set for LLM fine-tuning. Secondly, Qwen is trained with the train set just generated through three approaches, namely C2IO (context to instruction and output), C2I2O (context to instruction to output), and C2O2I (context to output to instruction). Finally, we employ the eight metrics mentioned above to evaluate the effectiveness of Qwen-IG in the task of generating instructions. The experimental results demonstrate Qwen-IG has increased at least 9.6\% on complexity, 23\% on answer relevancy and 17\% on diversity.},

While the need for frameworks and solutions to support AI governance is widely recognized, understanding and addressing the real-world needs of AI practitioners in operationalizing governance remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we conducted semi-structured interviews using a design probe with AI governance practitioners across various industry sectors. Our findings provide insights into the experiences and pain points of industry practitioners in AI governance, highlighting key challenges in achieving performance goals, assessing societal impact, securing user data, and navigating technical difficulties. We also identified their technical and explainability needs, including practical guidance on addressing violations, as well as more detailed explanations of AI models, data, and evaluation. We discuss design guidelines for AI governance tools that effectively support practitioners’ needs.},

However, using IGAI has challenges, such as encoded biases, which might reinforce stereotypes and harm underrepresented communities. We conducted a case study to explore how using IGAI alters the co-design process of public parks through public engagement. We use data collected from interviews with immigrants discussing the Puente Hills Landfill Park design in Los Angeles, which will re-purpose a former landfill into a new public park. We use Dream Studio as a Design Probe, generating images from the interviewees’ insights and critically reflecting on the design process through internal interviews and a reflective workshop. We analyze our case in three domains: Opportunities, Risks and Challenges, and Features and Requirements. In the opportunities domain, we discuss how the enhanced translation of words to images changes the relationship between stakeholder engagement, multiplicity, and efficiency. In the risks and challenges domain, we discuss how IGAI might enhance power imbalances and biases. Finally, we reflect on what features would ease the safe and responsible use of IGAI to engage citizens in co-designing public parks.},
