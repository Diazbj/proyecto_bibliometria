We hope that, like us, you are looking forward to a highly productive and engaging symposium that provides ample opportunity to renew old relationships, build new connections, and learn about the latest advances in our field. While we are sure that there will be a few surprises along the way, we hope and expect that we won't experience anything nearly as disruptive as the opening days of the pandemic, which occurred when we last tried to gather here in 2020.Our theme for this year's symposium is "Blazing New Trails in CS Education." This broad theme captures the exceptional work being performed by this community to enhance our teaching, improve our assessments, attract diverse students, and all of the other laudable projects, initiatives, and undertakings that affect positive change. The breadth of the program is substantial - there truly should be something for everyone. In fact, your biggest challenge may be deciding which session to attend in each time slot because there is so much going on! We know that many of you want to attend as many sessions as possible while you are here in Portland, but we encourage you to also find a little bit of time for yourself so that you leave Portland refreshed, renewed and encouraged, rather than exhausted or burnt out.},

AIware aims to be an annual conference that brings the software engineering community together in anticipation of the upcoming changes driven by Foundation Models (FMs) and looks at them from the perspective of AI-powered software and their evolution.        AIware 2024 prioritizes fostering discussions about the latest developments in the interdisciplinary field of AIware rather than solely focusing on the presentation of papers. The emphasis is on engaging conversations from diverse backgrounds to identify emerging research challenges and establish a new research agenda for the community in the Foundation Model era. To present papers and for discussions, the two-day conference will have five sessions themed around AIware Vision, SE for AIware, Human - AI Conversation, Security \&amp; Safety and AIware for Software Lifecycle Activities. Furthermore, the conference program will include two keynotes and five industry talks. The final session in the conference program will be dedicated to presenting accepted papers of the AIware challenge track.},

abstract = {In the last decade, deep learning and word embeddings have made significant impacts on information retrieval (IR) by adding techniques based in neural networks and language models. At the same time, certain search modalities such as neural IR and conversational search have become more popular. This book, written by international academic and industry experts, brings the field up to date with detailed discussions of these new approaches and techniques. The book is organized in three sections: Foundations, Adaptations and Concerns, and Verticals.Under Foundations, we address topics that form the basic structure of any modern IR system, including recommender systems. These new techniques are developed to augment indexing, retrieval, and ranking. Neural IR, recommender systems, evaluation, query-driven functionality, and knowledge graphs are covered in this section.IR systems need to adapt to specific user characteristics and preferences, and techniques that were considered too niche a few years ago are now a matter of system design consideration. The Adaptations and Concerns section covers the following topics: conversational search, cross-language retrieval, temporal extraction and retrieval, bias in retrieval systems, and privacy in search.While web search engines are the most popular information access point, there are cases where specific verticals provide a better experience in terms of content and relevance. The Verticals section describes eCommerce, professional search, personal collections, music retrieval, and biomedicine as examples.}

For the first time since 1978, our symposium is being held in the "Steel City" of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, at the intersection of the Allegheny, Ohio, and Monongahela rivers. We are looking forward to four days of productive and informative presentations, vibrant and engaging discussions, and an overall wonderful experience with our SIGCSE community members. We are confident that our program of events provides meaningful and productive experiences for all.Our theme for this year is "Leading the Transformation". Our theme reflects the role of the computer science education community in adapting educational practice to new technologies and challenges. With advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) transforming both academia and the workplace, the computer science education community has a unique opportunity to help shape the future use and application of computing. Our program this year is quite diverse and offers something for everyone, so please take time to peruse the schedule and choose the sessions which appeal to you. Pittsburgh is also an exciting city with lots to see and do, so you are encouraged to enjoy all the city has to offer.The format of the 2025 Technical Symposium is similar to 2024 in many ways. We will once again have a program that extends into Saturday afternoon, including papers and the Nifty Assignment session after lunch. We will also again have three Birds-of-a-Feather sessions, two on Thursday evening and one during lunch on Friday. For online attendees, we will continue to offer streaming of keynotes, the Nifty Assignment session, the First-Timers Lunch presentation, and a small set of paper, panel, and special sessions.This year we received almost 1200 submissions. Submission statistics for all of the Technical Symposium's tracks can be found in the table that follows. Papers were submitted to one of three tracks (Computing Education Research, Experience Reports and Tools, Position and Curricula Initiatives) with reviewing tailored to each track. Each paper submission was reviewed by at least three reviewers, with a substantial proportion of papers receiving four (or more) reviews, plus a meta review. We sincerely appreciate the work of the more than 800 reviewers and 112 Associate Program Chairs who contributed to the creation of this years' program. Their reviews helped us decide which submissions were accepted while also providing detailed feedback that allowed authors to further improve the final versions of their submissions.},
