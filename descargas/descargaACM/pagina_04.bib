abstract = {With the rapid development of the Internet and the exponential growth of network information resources, how to help users quickly obtain valuable information has become a major challenge. As the key technology of this problem, recommendation algorithm has become an important tool in the information age. However, most existing recommendation systems, such as traditional deep learning recommendation algorithms, still have problems such as cold start of new users and improper handling of dynamic changes in user behavior. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a fusion Group behavior characteristics and time series characteristics of the recommendation algorithm model Group-Temporal Recommendation Fusion (GTRF). Based on deep learning algorithm, the model extracts group behavioral characteristics by using graph attention network to deal with the problem of cold start, obtains time series characteristics by using gated convolution and GRU to deal with the problem of dynamic changes in user behavior, and finally uses cross-attention mechanism to effectively integrate these two types of features to achieve high-precision prediction of recommended content. GTRF not only solves the problems such as cold start of new users and dynamic change of user behavior, but also significantly improves the comprehensive performance of recommendation algorithm, showing the indispensable and great potential of recommendation algorithm in information retrieval.},

abstract = {With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as DeepSeek and GPT-4, the cost of generating false information has decreased dramatically, making detection more difficult to recognize. Traditional approaches, such as GPT-4o and chain-of-thought (CoT) frameworks, having low accuracy or efficiency. To better solve these problems, this paper introduces Dynamic Semantic Structure Rule Constrained Adversarial Training (DSC-AT), which uses balanced semantic fidelity and steganography to enhance adversarial sample optimisation, achieving an 82\% deception rate. Meanwhile, the Semantic-Robust Unified Architecture (SRUA) scheme integrates text classification layer, logical verification layer and uncertainty detection layer to improve accuracy. Besides, to better train the model, we provide the Content Reinforcement Learning-based Tactical Adversarial Defence (RL-TAD) model simulates the interaction between the attacker and the defender, improves the training strategy by using backpropagation descent. Experimental results show that contrast to CoT, SRUA improves the detection accuracy to 92.1 percent and reduces the false alarm rate by 65 percent, which provided an efficient and flexible solution for identifying LLM-generated misinformation.},

Using this hybrid approach, we conducted new word discovery experiments on a self-annotated dataset, utilizing word embedding vectors and different word position annotation sets.

abstract = {Aiming at the traditional fall detection algorithms that suffer from low detection accuracy and poor real-time performance in dealing with small targets and multi-scale features in complex scenes, this study proposes a fall detection algorithm based on an improved YOLOv8 model. First, the SCConv module is utilized to combine with the C2f module in the YOLOv8 backbone network to construct the C2fSC module, which enhances the feature extraction capability of the model while reducing the computational complexity. Second, the SPPF module is integrated with the BAM attention mechanism to weaken the influence of background interference. Finally, WIoU is used to replace the original loss function to optimize the positioning accuracy of the bounding box and enhance the overall performance of the model. The experimental results show that compared with the original YOLOv8 model, the improved model improves 4.9\%, 4.2\%, and 4.4\% in P, R, and mAP metrics, respectively, and the number of parameters and FLOPs are only 2.8M and 7.7G, which proves that the improved model has excellent robustness and effectiveness.},

abstract = {Audio-driven talking-face synthesis is of significant importance in various application scenarios, such as remote meetings, AR/VR, and digital humans. Currently, the work in this field can be broadly divided into two categories: implicit representation-based methods and explicit representation-based methods. Implicit representation-based methods often use neural network models to represent human face. For example, NeRF (Neural Radiance Field) uses MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) to represent human face, and by inputting the camera pose, NeRF renders a face image from that viewpoint. When training with audio features, it can render face images with different facial movements. However, due to the lack of editability and slow rendering speed of implicit representations, the industry has been exploring new representation methods. Explicit representation-based methods commonly use 3D Gaussian representations of the face, which offers high editability and nearly real-time rendering speed, making these methods surpass implicit-based approaches in many metrics. However, it is difficult to incorporate other signals during the rendering optimization process. To address this issue, this paper combines 3D Gaussian representations with the 3D head model FLAME (Faces Learned with an Articulated Model and Expressions). The FLAME model represents the face's shape and facial movements with a set of parameters. In this paper, audio signals are first transformed into parameters representing facial movements, which are used to initialize the 3D model generated by the parameters, followed by rendering optimization. This paper proposes a 3D Gaussian-based audio-driven lip-sync video generation system. It consists of two main modules: the audio-to-facial movement module and the 3D Gaussian rendering module. The audio-to-facial movement module uses the extracted audio features to generate parameters that control the FLAME model, converting the audio input into natural and reasonable lip shapes and facial movements. The 3D Gaussian rendering module initializes the 3D Gaussian with the FLAME model, optimizes the rendered image from coarse to fine, and finally stitches the generated images together to create a continuous video. Experiments show that this system can generate lip-synchronized, accurate, high-fidelity videos.},

However, at this stage, they can only be trained using 3D point cloud data to generate simple 3D shapes based on point cloud representations. Building on this, we propose HoloDiT. It uses a set of real-world 2D images and corresponding camera poses as input, generating 3D auxiliary samples that are fed into a Transformer-based 3D diffusion model for training in 3D shape generation. By training the rendering function to generate color and density, we can restore the color details of object surfaces. This enables HoloDiT to generate realistic 3D shapes from 2D images. We trained on the real-world CO3Dv2 dataset, and the generated results demonstrate competitive quality and consistency compared to existing 3D generation models.},

abstract = {The Internet has enabled online learning to become an important means for students to acquire knowledge, and student cognitive diagnosis models have played a key role in this process. These models can evaluate students' learning behaviors and knowledge mastery, providing support for personalized learning. Unfortunately, traditional models have their limitations when dealing with complex relational data related mainly to the relationship between students and problems, while the characteristics as well as potential relationships among students are almost left neglected. In response, this paper proposes a Neural Network Student Cognitive Diagnosis Model Based on Multi-Relational Graph (MGNCD) that brings together the powers of Graph Attention Network (GAT) and Relational Graph Convolutional Network (RGCN) to model multi-dimensional heterogeneous nodes such as students, classes, problems, and skills. The introduction of various edge types and random edge connection strategies allowed the model to tackle data sparsity and heterogeneity. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model outperforms traditional methods in accuracy (ACC) and area under the curve (AUC), which provides an encouraging novel insight into cognitive diagnosis.},

abstract = {In recent years, the quantitative analysis of the green quality of urban streets has become a hot spot in the cross-research of computer vision and urban environment. In this paper, we propose a semantic segmentation method based on a dynamic multimodal noise addition technique combined with the SegFormer model to improve the robustness of street view image segmentation in complex environments. The study takes five major roads (West Beijing Road, North Taiping Road, Changjiang Road, Yihe Road, and Central Road) in Nanjing as objects, and based on the streetscape and remote sensing data of the vegetation growth season from 2017 to 2022, the Gaussian noise, motion blur, and weather effects are simulated by the multimodal noise addition technique, which effectively improves the adaptability of the model to the dynamic interference. The experiments showed that the Green View Index analysis revealed a general upward trend of street greening (average increase of 0.94\%). Furthermore, the Kendall rank correlation analysis reveals the positive correlation between environmental factors and green visualization rate, and the influence law of environmental factors on green perception is verified. This study provides a high-precision computer vision analysis framework for urban greening planning and promotes the application of semantic segmentation models in complex urban scenes.},

abstract = {At present, network security becomes more and more important, but the security vulnerability data in various databases are relatively dispersed and it is difficult to establish the connection between them, network security knowledge graph can associate the security vulnerability data of different databases together, and it can be updated in real time with the latest security vulnerabilities. This paper establishes network security knowledge graph based on CAPEC, CWE and other security libraries. Aiming at the problem that TransR model cannot utilize entity semantic information, TransR-Roberta model is proposed, and splicing layer, attention layer and convolutional layer are added on the basis of TransR model. And for the problem that the quality of negative samples generated by Bernoulli negative sampling is too low, a clustering-based negative sampling optimization method is proposed. Firstly, the clustering task is accomplished with the help of Gaussian hybrid clustering algorithm on the entities in the security vulnerability knowledge graph to label the entities with clusters. In the next step, the clustered vulnerability entities are reclassified using support vector machine. Finally, a classifier combined with Facolloss function is added to the loss function of the TransR model, which is used to improve the ability of the knowledge inference model to distinguish between positive and negative samples. The experimental results show that the improved model improves the hit@N, MR and MMR metrics for the knowledge reasoning task.},

Survivability testing is usually implemented by simulating real hacker attacks, but this kind of testing and evaluation method depends on the professional level of testers to a large extent. There are problems such as incomplete testing and low testing efficiency. This paper comprehensively utilizes the ATT&amp;CK (Adversarial Tactics, Technologies, and Common Knowledge) and D3FEND (Defensive Tactics, Technologies, and Common Knowledge) frameworks of MITRE, aiming to propose a new cybersecurity survivability testing technology. Through in-depth analysis of the attack tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) in the ATT&amp;CK framework, combined with the defense strategies and measures in the D3FEND framework, this paper designs a cybersecurity survivability evaluation program. This scheme not only evaluates the protection, detection, response and recovery capabilities of the system against network attacks, but also provides a scientific and perfect defense measures for the system. The case study further verifies the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, and shows how to conduct survivability testing against attacks on the Linux operating system.

abstract = {In order to study the compressive strength of cemented gravel, a compressive strength prediction model was established; with 142 groups of in-house uniaxial compressive strength test data of cemented gravel with different mixing ratios as the object of study, the 11 influencing factors in the samples were downscaled by using the principal component analysis method, and the downscaled principal components were used as the input layer of the BPNN, so as to establish the compressive strength prediction of cemented gravel based on the PCA-BPNN model. The results show that when the number of principal components is 3, the cumulative contribution rate of the principal components reaches 86.483\%, and the contribution rates of the three principal components are 65.084\%, 11.702\%, 9.097\%, and the eigenvalues of the three principal components are all greater than 1. Then the three principal components are used as the input layer to build the compressive strength model of cemented gravel based on PCA-BPNN, and the RMSEs of the training set and test set are 0.253 and 0.28, respectively. The RMSE of the training set and the test set are 0.253 and 0.286, and the R2 is 0.947 and 0.942, which are not much different from the BPNN model with the number of nodes in the input layer of 6 and 11 before dimensionality reduction, and they are obviously better than the BPNN model in the convergence speed and training time. It can be seen that the PCA-BPNN model has good prediction effect and prediction efficiency, especially drastically reducing the training time, which provides a new idea for the prediction research of the mechanical properties of cemented gravel.},

abstract = {With the continuous development of blockchain technology, an increasing number of scholars have begun to consider the harm of data leakage during on-chain transactions and the requirement for privacy data protection. Zero-knowledge range proof, as a cryptographic technology, can perform legitimacy verification of data while hiding private data, effectively realizing the protection of private data on the blockchain, so it is increasingly used to protect blockchain privacy. The mainstream construction methods for range proofs can be mainly divided into two categories: n-ary decomposition and square decomposition. This paper introduces and analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of these construction methods in detail. Then, based on these two methods, a zero-knowledge range proof scheme based on multibit split square decomposition (ZKRPMSSD) is proposed, which requires no trusted third-party setting and can achieve range proofs for arbitrary ranges. The proposed ZKRPMSSD scheme processes the original data based on the multibit split idea, and the acquisition method of secret value components is optimized so that the acquisition of components does not depend on the scale of the original problem. Additionally, the algorithms for proof generation and verification in the ZKRPMSSD scheme are redesigned based on the (Sigma ) protocol and Pedersen commitments, effectively reducing the computational cost of the proof generation and verification process. Finally, typical n-ary decomposition and square decomposition zero-knowledge range proof construction schemes are taken for comparative analysis. Under 256-bit security and the same problem scale, experimental results indicate that ZKRPMSSD has advantages in proof and verification time costs.},

abstract = {Graph classification has significant applications in various domains, including chemical molecular structure prediction, social network analysis, recommendation systems, and biological network analysis, and has received considerable attention in recent years. However, real-world graph datasets often exhibit class imbalance, where the disproportionate distribution of classes can cause models to favor the majority class, reducing prediction accuracy for minority classes. Notably, minority or anomalous classes often hold unique value in many practical scenarios. This paper proposes a framework for graph classification under category imbalance named Generator Imbalanced Graph Classification(GIGC). GIGC employs a set of learnable augmented graph generators orchestrated by an automated augmentation strategy to enhance minority-class graphs. This approach increases the diversity of minority-class samples, balances the dataset's class distribution, and improves the model's generalization capabilities. Simultaneously, k-reciprocal nearest neighbors are utilized to capture inter-graph relationships more effectively, leveraging the properties of symmetry and reciprocity. Subsequently, Graph-of-Graph Neural Networks are used to model inter-graph relationships, capturing global associations between graphs at a higher level. This enables the model to better capture and utilize inter-graph information. By leveraging the latent connections between minority-class graphs and other graphs, GIGC enriches the representation of minority-class graphs, mitigating the negative effects of class imbalance on classification performance. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate that GIGC outperforms baseline methods in graph classification. Specifically, F1-macro and F1-micro are improved by at least 1.12\% and 2.62\%, respectively. These results validate the effectiveness of GIGC in addressing class imbalance in graph classification tasks.},

However, these models are heavily dependent on the size and quality of the training corpus and exhibit poor performance when faced with unknown errors. Inspired by adversarial learning, this paper focuses on Chinese character input scenarios and propose an effective attack strategy to generate more valuable training examples in these scenarios. This strategy jointly utilizes the attention mechanism and the logit output to determine the attack position and generates misspelling instances in a perturbed pinyin manner. The generated adversarial samples are then gradually added to the training set to train the model. Further, this paper explores the effect of the proportion of samples in the adversarial training process on model performance. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy are demonstrated on three different architectural baseline models.},

abstract = {Emotional recognition can help machines to capture the emotional state of human beings, which is an indispensable technology for human-computer interaction and the realization of artificial intelligence. Electroencephalogram (EEG) has been applied to emotion recognition due to its good temporal and spatial resolution. How to capture the correlation of long-distance time-series EEG signal data from both temporal and spatial dimensions and directly affect the effect of emotion recognition is a difficulty in the BCI research. Transformer model can extract long-term correlations of time-series signals. In this paper, a new electroencephalogram emotion recognition method based on spatiotemporal fusion Vision Transformer is proposed. The feature of EEG signals is reconstructed by the tunable Q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT) method. The spatiotemporal correlation between the acquisition channel and the temporal signal is established by position coding for the convolved features. The hybrid model of multiscale convolutional and Vision Transformer (MC-ViT) is utilized for feature extraction and emotion classification. The EEG emotion recognition method based on spatio-temporal fusion vision transformer proposed in this paper has achieved good EEG emotion classification effect on the SEED dataset, which outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning methods.},

abstract = {Shipboard emergencies can easily induce secondary events because of any time and space transition. Carrier-based aircraft emergencies have complexity, tight coupling and strong real-time characteristics. Therefore, it is of great significance to reasonably predict the development trend of the incident in the emergency treatment to reduce the harm. Due to the sudden and random nature of naval battlefield accidents, some incidents are not covered by the historical case base. Traditional retrieval approaches to event prediction using case knowledge are limited by the sparsity of events and the cold-start problem. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-graph neural network for event development trend prediction, which disassembles events into event features and introduces the shipboard aircraft domain knowledge graph. We produce a data set around the event features of carrier-based aircraft on the simulation platform. The results show that the graph neural network with knowledge graph is superior in modeling the higher-order semantic association between event features. Compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods, our approach exhibits significant improvements.},

abstract = {In scenarios with fixed time intervals, discrete-time dynamic graph (DTDG) is used to represent dynamic networks, such as social networks, traffic networks and biological networks. Existing models introduce self-attention mechanism for structural representation learning on discrete-time dynamic graph and demonstrate good performance in this field. However, temporal encoder in these models focuses on the entire time domain, introducing noise and limiting the model's ability to extract critical information. To address this issue, we propose the DyLF model based on Longformer mechanism. By incorporating the Longformer-based self-attention mechanism, DyLF can flexibly adjust the range of visible time domain while encoding temporal features of nodes in dynamic graphs and efficiently capture temporal dependencies between snapshots, thereby enhancing the ability to extract more effective temporal information. Extensive experiments show that DyLF achieves an average improvement of 4.28\% in AUC and 6.87\% in F1_score with the existing baseline, demonstrate that it is better suited for handling DTDGs.},

abstract = {While Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various general tasks, developing domain-specific model remains an urgent need. This requires fine-tuning with high-quality data. Extraction of question-answer (QA) pairs from domain knowledge documents is a crucial prerequisite for fine-tuning, especially when these documents containing complex charts and unstructured data. This paper introduces a framework for extracting QA pairs from charts, which combines OCR and VLM to fully leverage contextual information in the documents and generate deep, contextually relevant questions. Our method first uses OCR for initial chart recognition, followed by a VLM-based “Caption-Reflection'' paradigm to reduce misrecognition. We then design a context localization module which combines local and global contexts to generate relevant QA pairs. Additionally, we construct a specialized chart knowledge base to guide the generation of QA pairs. Experimental results show significant improvement in both chart recognition performance and QA pairs generation quality: the average precision increases from 0.52 to 0.90, the average F1 Score improves from 0.64 to 0.94, the average FPR decreases from 0.55 to 0 respectively. The generated QA pairs perform well in terms of statistical relevance and contextual consistency.},

This approach solves the complex access control challenges arising from data sharing and large number of users in power grid regulation systems. First, the Aprior algorithm is used to mine strong association rules from the user authority relationship to reveal the potential relationship between resources. Then, the user rights relationship is enhanced, resource similarity is calculated, and collaborative filtering is used to generate recommended values for unauthorized resources. Finally, the access control policy is classified and authorized according to the recommended value, and the automatic generation of the policy is realized. The experimental results show that this method can not only generate access control policies automatically, but also assign new permissions effectively and ensure the privacy of resource data.},

Firstly, train corresponding VAE models for different types of attack traffic samples; Secondly, the SMOTE algorithm is used to extract the original samples and their neighboring samples from the dataset and store them in pairs; Then, the paired samples are fed into the trained VAE model to learn their latent representations separately, and the latent representations of the original and neighboring samples are linearly interpolated; Finally, the results of linear interpolation are fed into the trained VAE decoder to expand the new samples. In this way, a balanced dataset can be established to enable deep learning models to fully learn the features of a small number of samples. The experimental results showed that using convolutional neural network models for multi classification experiments on the NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15 datasets, S-VAE increased the classification recall by 3.75 and 3.06 percentage points, respectively, and the F1 score by 6.49 and 4.29 percentage points, respectively, compared to the baseline model.},

However, the similarity of character sounds and shapes poses considerable challenges in Chinese spelling correction.

Therefore, the paper proposes the Chinese Error Correction based on Whole Words Replacement fusing Confusion Set (WWR-CS) model which utilizes the whole words replacement method, incorporating confusion set in the noise generation module. Furthermore, due to the fact that most spelling errors stem from phonetic misuse, the model incorporates the pronunciation of Chinese characters and comprehensively considers character correction and pinyin prediction to obtain the final correction result. The experimental results on the Sighan datasets exhibits improved performance compared to the models proposed in recent years, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

abstract = {Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) aims to address incomplete facts in Knowledge Graphs (KGs). As a mainstream approach for KGC, text-based methods are limited in performance due to insufficient knowledge caused by constraints in fine-tuning data. To incorporate broader external knowledge, some researchers explored KGC approaches based on large language models (LLMs), but general-purpose LLMs lack direct awareness of knowledge graph domain knowledge, making it challenging for them to independently perform KGC tasks. To balance the dependence of text-based methods on knowledge graph domain knowledge and LLMs on external knowledge, we propose Collaborative Enhancement using Large Language Model for KGC (ColKGC). We define the prompt template to implement the interaction between the text-based model and the LLMs, and divide the knowledge graph completion process into two stages. In the concept enhancement stage, we supplement the fine-tuning data by interacting with the prompts of the LLMs to enrich the graph domain knowledge learned by the text-based model. In completion inference stage, we adopted the iterative interaction strategy, taking the text-based model output as the prompt and taking the interaction content of the previous stage as the context to enhance the inference, which improved the LLMs' understanding of the KGC task.

abstract = {Accurate measurement of liquid metal levels is critical to the safety and efficiency of industrial process monitoring and automation. Traditional contact-based measurement methods face significant limitations in high temperature and extreme environments, such as safety risks, inaccurate measurements due to interference with the environment, and short equipment life. To address these challenges, this study proposes an innovative non-contact measurement method using a visual depth estimation technique based on deep learning. The MiDaS model captures an image of a liquid metal surface by a monocular camera in an industrial environment. A deep neural network then estimates their depth by processing these images. By calculating the vertical distance between the liquid metal level point and a predefined reference point, real-time and accurate monitoring of the liquid level height is realized. This study not only introduces a new non-contact solution for measuring the height of liquid metal surfaces, but also enhances the potential applications of deep learning in industrial vision measurement and depth estimation.},

abstract = {Aiming to address the need for child supervision in closed public spaces, this paper proposes an intelligent access control system based on face recognition. The system adopts lightweight MTCNN and MobileFaceNet algorithms to dynamically bind the identities of children and adults by generating unique ID codes (timestamp + random six-digit number). During entry, an adult generates an ID code via face detection and associates it with the child's information. During exit, a child can only pass if their ID code matches the associated adult's ID. Experimental results demonstrate that the system achieves a recognition accuracy of 99.93\%, a single binding time of 2.8 seconds, and a database response time of less than 10 ms under high concurrency (1000 QPS). This system enables accurate guardianship without pre-registration and effectively reduces the risk of children getting lost or being taken by unauthorized individuals.},

abstract = {Traditional homography estimation uses methods such as SIFT and ORB in feature extraction but suffers from problems such as feature sparsity in large baseline scenes with large viewing angles and low overlap, causing inaccurate homography estimation. This paper proposes an unsupervised method that combines edge detection and feature fusion to solve the above problems. Firstly, three layers of image features are extracted by the feature pyramid; secondly, the edge detection module extracts the edge features of the input image and feature map; then, the features are fused by adaptive feature fusion and attentional feature fusion; finally, correlation is computed layer-by-layer using the fused features to estimate the homography. In this paper, experiments have been conducted to verify the method's effectiveness by calculating the PSNR and SSIM metrics. Experimental results show that this method can estimate homography more accurately than other related methods when stitching large baseline images.},

After a rigorous data cleaning process and removal of outliers, the advantages of CNN-LSTM Transformer model fusion are utilized. CNN extracts local features, LSTM captures long-term dependencies, and Transformer processes global dependencies, effectively improving prediction accuracy. Through in-depth analysis of 1-120 day data, key indicators of eel meat quality changes from 121-180 days were successfully predicted.

abstract = {Spectrum anomaly detection involves identifying abnormal signals within the electromagnetic spectrum. Most existing methods focus on traditional abnormal signals and can achieve high detection rates through training and testing of neural network models. However, the presence of adversarial samples greatly reduces the performance of existing network models. To address this issue, a spectrum anomaly detection algorithm based on attention mechanism residual neural network is proposed, which can significantly improve the robustness of network models without adversarial training. This method integrates the attention mechanism module and the Residual Network (ResNet), using ResNet18 to process spectrogram data, avoiding gradient vanishing and overfitting during iteration, and using attention mechanism to enhance the model's attention to local information in spectrogram data. The experimental results show that the predictive performance of the proposed algorithm is superior to the compared algorithms. Compared with ResNet18 and feature transformation based image retrieval adversarial defense algorithms, the new algorithm has increased the AUC value for abnormal signal detection by approximately 47\% and 24\%, respectively, effectively improving the robustness of the network model and reducing the negative impact of adversarial samples on the neural network model. The experimental results verify the effectiveness and superiority of the residual neural network model based on attention mechanism.},

Currently, deep learning is widely used for image recognition and classification. However, the complex characteristics of the intermingled growth of weeds and crops are the main factors affecting the extraction of weed features. Based on an extensive review of domestic and foreign literature, and combining the research progress and methods of deep learning in the field of image recognition, this paper designs a method that can identify weeds with complex characteristics, effectively improving the accuracy of weed image recognition. This provides a favorable reference for the rapid and precise targeted spraying of herbicides in agricultural intelligent equipment or other devices beneficial to human life.},

abstract = {Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved significant progress and been widely applied across various industries. However, a series of significant challenges have also been posed, such as the hallucination, where the generated attributes of a target are inconsistent with the information in the image. Recent works have primarily focused on improving generation performance by training the multimodal alignment module of the model with additional data. However, this approach incurs higher costs and introduces redundant information due to the reliance on large amounts of additional data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal mitigation framework, termed MH-PEFT. Specifically, we introduce an effective data augmentation strategy that leverages existing data to generate additional attribute-related information, thereby enhancing the model's generative capabilities. Furthermore, we develop a PEFT-based training approach specifically tailored to mitigate multimodal hallucination in LVLMs. Notably, our framework features a plug-and-play design, which enhances its robustness and facilitates its deployment in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark datasets.},

This model combines global context with gated slot attention mechanisms, effectively integrating local session graphs with global context graphs to track item changes both within and across sessions. By using gated slot attention, GC-DMRec focuses on critical time points, extracting more representative features while reducing noise. Experimental results on datasets such as Diginetica, Tmall, and Nowplaying demonstrate that GC-DMRec outperforms other existing methods in terms of accuracy and reliability.},

abstract = {This paper aims to design a chatbot application to help people find an appropriate restaurant based on users' preferences and transportation modes. It also aims to explore whether a machine learning-based chat agent is capable of accomplishing all the tasks precisely, or whether it could be optimized by collaborating with other simple agents. This paper establishes a chatbot environment along with a series of agents (machine learning agent, grammar checker agent, spelling checker agent, restaurant searcher), designed to assist users in finding a restaurant mainly based on what transportation they use and if a restaurant is found, the chatbot could display the route to this place in the prompt also with map details by employing the Google map API. The machine learning agent acting as the brain of this chatbot, could not only be able to evoke other agents corresponding to users’ input but also could directly store what kinds of transportation are taken by users and pass to Google map API to search appropriate restaurants instead of fully relying on a restaurant searcher agent (rule-based agent). To examine whether multiple agents coordinate with each other could outperform a single agent. A contrast experiment is conducted to conclude the result, which involves 15 participants who run through this program under two different setups (with and without spelling and grammar checkers) and each of them would give a query to this chatbot but this query would be dealt with and without spelling and grammar checker respectively. The result would be quantitatively evaluated by two metrics: Success Rate: successfully finding a restaurant and showing the map; the Total of Queries. Results suggest that pre-processing input with spelling and grammar checkers significantly improves the chatbot's performance, achieving an 80\% success rate (12 out of 15 queries). In contrast, when input is not pre-processed, the success rate drops to 46.66\% (7 out of 15 queries). This indicates that the involvement of spelling and grammar checker agents enhances the accuracy and efficiency of restaurant searches, making the collaborative multi-agent setup more effective. Moreover, it could demonstrate that this chatbot environment is well constructed since it could successfully provide suitable restaurants given users’ requirements.},

abstract = {Most current generative models for anomaly detection, which rely on reconstruction methods, primarily use either Variational Autoencoders or Generative Adversarial Networks. However, VAEs tend to suffer from poor reconstruction quality, while GANs face challenges related to training stability and limited pattern coverage. Additionally, due to privacy and security concerns, the available training data for anomaly detection is often limited, whereas generative models typically require large datasets to avoid the risk of overfitting. To overcome these challenges, we introduce an unsupervised anomaly detection model utilizing diffusion techniques, designed specifically for tabular data, using a reconstruction-based approach. We adopt the diffusion model as the backbone for anomaly detection, aiming to enhance reconstruction quality and ensure training stability. To further improve reconstruction quality and accelerate inference, we employ a truncated diffusion strategy during inference. What's more, to overcome the challenge of insufficient training data, we introduce a SMOTE-based data augmentation method optimized for feature space in tabular data, incorporating a VAE to address the limitations of the original SMOTE algorithm in capturing complex data structures and handling nonlinear relationships. Experimental results on real-world datasets validate that our method achieves higher detection accuracy compared to conventional methods, demonstrating its effectiveness.},
